title: "AI Bots"

AI Bots in CometChat are designed to facilitate conversations with users. Each AI Bot is associated with a specific [AI Instruction](/ai/instructions).

## Before you begin

</Frame>

1. Configure the AI settings through the CometChat dashboard as detailed in the [Overview section](/ai-chatbots/overview).
2. Navigate to AI Bots section and add a new bot by clicking on the **"+"** button.
3. Enter bot details like `UID`, `Avatar`, `Bot name` and assign a `Instruction` from the dropdown. Then "Enable" the bot.
4. These details can be edited by clicking on the three dots. Similarly, you can also delete a bot.

## How does it work?

### Direct Conversation

Users can engage in direct conversations with bots by typing messages or asking questions. Bots respond in real-time, providing relevant information or responses based on their configured personality.

### Ask for Suggestions in a Conversation

Users can also request suggestions or recommendations from bots. Bots analyze user input and provide suggestions accordingly. For example, a user may ask a bot for movie recommendations, and the bot will respond with a list of movie suggestions.

<Note>

Bots Suggestion are request-response based, so they will not know about the previous questions asked when asking for a suggestion. However, an end-user can converse with a Bot in a Direct Conversation.

</Note>

CometChat AI Bot goes through the messages of a conversation to understand the context of a conversation & answer a question asked to the Bot. The CometChat SDK has a method to ask a question to the CometChat AI Bot. It returns a string response.

The number of messages to be fetched to generate relevant suggestion is configurable. By default the CometChat AI Bot takes the recent `1000` messages of a conversation. It can be configured to timestamp specific or for unread messages only.

| Configuration | Value                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| lastNMessages | This will fetch specific number of messages.           |
| fromTimestamp | This will fetch messages from a particular timestamp.  |
| toTimestamp   | This will fetch messages until a particular timestamp. |
| unreadOnly    | This will fetch only the unread messages.              |

<Note>

While using any configuration mentioned above a maximum of **only** `1000` messages will be fetched.

## Implementation

### SDKs

To implement AI Bots in the platform of your choice, you may utilize the following code samples:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JS/React Native/Ionic SDK">
```js
const receiverId = "UID/GUID";
const receiverType = "user/group";
const botUid = "UID";
const question = "Question for Bot";
const configuration = { lastNMessages: 100 };

CometChat.askBot(
  receiverId,
  receiverType,
  botUid,
  question,
  configuration
).then(
  (answer) => {
    console.log("Bot Reply", answer);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("An error occurred while fetching bot response.", error);
  }
);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Java">
```java
String receiverId = 'UID/GUID';
String receiverType = CometChatConstants.RECEIVER_TYPE_USER; //'user/group'
String bootId = ""; //'user/group'
String question = "";
JSONObject configuration =  new JSONObject();
try {
    configuration.put("lastNMessages", 100);
} catch (JSONException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}

CometChat.askBot(receiverId, receiverType, bootId, question, configuration, new CometChat.CallbackListener<String>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(String s) {
        Logger.error(TAG, "aiFeature: " + s);
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(CometChatException e) {
        Logger.error(TAG, e.getMessage());
    }
});
```

CometChat.askBot(receiverId, receiverType, bootId, question, configuration,
    object : CometChat.CallbackListener<String>() {
        override fun onSuccess(s: String) {
            Log.e(TAG, "aiFeature: $s")
        }

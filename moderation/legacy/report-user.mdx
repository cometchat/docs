## How does it work?

The extension has the following functionalities:

1. Allowing end-users to report other users.
2. Allowing admins to login to the Dashboard to take action on the reports.

### 1. Reporting a user

Users can be reported in either group conversations or one-on-one conversations.

By clicking on the user's avatar, you can show an item in the context menu called "Report". Clicking on the "Report" button should open up a modal asking for the reason.

Here's the description of the parameters that need to be passed to the extension:

| Parameters | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :---------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| uid        | String | The UID of the user that needs to be reported                                                                                              |
| reason     | String | Reason for reporting. This should be max 150 characters.                                                                                   |
| guid       | String | The GUID of the group in which the user is being reported.If the user is being reported in a one-on-one conversation, this can be skipped. |

Once you have the user to be reported along with the reason, make use of the callExtension method provided by the SDK to submit the report:

    // Error occurred
});
```

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(JSONObject jsonObject) {
        //On Success

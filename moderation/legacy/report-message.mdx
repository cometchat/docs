## How does it work?

The extension has the following functionalities:

1. Allowing end-users to report messages.
2. Allowing admins to login to the dashboard to take action on the reports.

### 1. Reporting a message

Messages can be reported in either group conversations or one-on-one conversations.

In the context menu of a message, you can have a "Report" button. Clicking it should open up a modal asking for the reason.

Here's the description of the parameters that need to be passed to the extension:

| Parameters | Value   | Description                                   |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| msgId      | Integer | The ID of the message that has to be reported |
| reason     | String  | The reason for reporting the message.         |

Once you have the message to be reported along with the reason, make use of the `callExtension` method provided by the SDK to submit the report:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```js
CometChat.callExtension('report-message', 'POST', 'v1/report', {
    "msgId": 123,
   "reason": "Contains profanity"
}).then(response => {
    // { success: true }
})
.catch(error => {
    // Error occurred
});
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Java">
```java
import org.json.simple.JSONObject;

JSONObject body=new JSONObject();

body.put("msgId", 123);
body.put("reason", "Contains profanity");

CometChat.callExtension("report-message", "POST", "/v1/report", body,
 new CometChat.CallbackListener < JSONObject > () {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(JSONObject jsonObject) {
        //On Success
    }
    @Override
    public void onError(CometChatException e) {
        //On Failure
    }
});
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.callExtension(slug: "report-message", type: .post, endPoint: "v1/report", body: [
  "msgId": 123,
  "reason":"Contains profanity"
] as [String : Any], onSuccess: { (response) in
         // Success
      }) { (error) in
         // Error occured
      }
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### 2. View reports and take action

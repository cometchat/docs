### Localization

With language localization, our Chat Widget adapts to the language of a specific country or region. Chat Widget allows you to detect the language of your users based on their browser settings and set the language of the widget accordingly. 

You can also set the language manually using the `CometChatWidget.localize` method.
The CometChat Widget supports localization for multiple languages, allowing you to provide a tailored experience for users across different regions.

You can find the list of supported languages and their corresponding language codes below:

<Accordion title="Preview Customizations (Optional)">

Before integrating the Visual Builder into your project, you can preview the chat experience by following these steps. This step is completely optional and can be skipped if you want to directly integrate the Visual Builder into your project.

> You can preview the experience:
> 
> 1. Open the `cometchat-app-react` folder.
> 2. Add credentials for your app in `src/index.tsx` (`src/main.tsx` incase for Vite):
> 
> ```javascript
> export const COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS = {
>   APP_ID: "", // Replace with your App ID
>   REGION: "", // Replace with your App Region
>   AUTH_KEY: "", // Replace with your Auth Key or leave blank if you are authenticating using Auth Token
> };
> ```
> 
> 3. Install dependencies:
> 
> ```
> npm i
> ```
> 
> 4. Run the app:
> 
> ```powershell
> npm start
> ```

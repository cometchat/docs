The ReactionsConfiguration supports the following properties:

### Configurable Properties

| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| reactionListConfiguration | An instance of `ReactionListConfiguration` which controls the configuration for the reaction list.        |
| reactionInfoConfiguration | An instance of `ReactionInfoConfiguration` which controls the configuration for the reaction information. |

    reactionListConfiguration: new ReactionListConfiguration({}),
    reactionInfoConfiguration: new ReactionInfoConfiguration({}),
    reactionClick: (reaction, message) => {
      // Write your custom function here
    },
    reactionsStyle: new ReactionsStyle({})
});
```

```javascript
    const messagesConfiguration = new MessagesConfiguration({
      messageListConfiguration:new MessageListConfiguration({
        reactionsConfiguration: reactionsConfig
      })
    })

```javascript
  <cometchat-conversations-with-messages [messagesConfiguration]="messagesConfiguration"  ></cometchat-conversations-with-messages>

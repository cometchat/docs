## Summary

Notification logs enable you to track Push, Email, and SMS notifications triggered for CometChat events. Notification logs provide insights into why a notification was not triggered for a specific event (maybe due to preferences). Additionally, responses from providers are logged to analyze success and failure patterns from the provider's end.

## Logs availability

When enabled, logging remains active for 7 days and automatically disables afterward. Logs collected during this period are available for review for up to 14 days—seven days while logging is active and an additional seven days after logging stops. After this period, the logs are permanently deleted.

## Supported providers

Push notification logging is supported for FCM, APNs, and custom providers. Email notification logs are generated for SendGrid and custom providers. SMS notification logging is supported for Twilio and custom providers.

## Supported events

Push notification logs are generated for **messages** and **replies** sent in one-on-one and group coversations, for message actions like **message edited**, **deleted** and **reactions** and in case of groups, it also logs the **group events**.

SMS and Email notifications are supported for **messages** and **replies** sent in one-on-one and group conversations.

## Available filters

The Get logs API supports various query parameters to filter logs for better insights. More details about the usage can be found in the [API explorer documentation](https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/notifications-logs).

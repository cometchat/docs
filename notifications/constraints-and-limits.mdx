## Constraints

To implement Notification features, the app must implement certain versions of UI Kits and SDKs. (Note: If you download a UI Kit, it has a corresponding Chat and Call SDK integrated into the same and does not have to be separately downloaded).

* All UI Kits above version 4 are supported. (For Flutter, `Calls UI Kit v4.3.0 & above` are supported)
* All Calls SDK versions are supported. (For Flutter, `Calls SDK v4.0.9 & above` are supported)
* Notifications are supported in iOS Chat SDK v4.0.51 and above, Android Chat SDK v4.0.9 and above, Flutter Chat SDK v4.0.15 and above, React Native Chat SDK v4.0.10 and above, JavaScript Chat SDK v4.0.8 and above and Ionic (Cordova) SDK v4.0.8 and above.
* Chat Widgets are not compatible with Push Notifications.

<Info>

It is possible to use Notification features without using UI Kits with an entirely SDK dependent solution with the above-mentioned SDK versions.

## Limitations

* iOS platform:
  * Calling notifications work when using APNS (VoIP). Calling notifications are not supported to work with FCM. (Applicable for native iOS, React Native iOS, Flutter iOS)
* Android platform:
  * Push notifications using FCM work on devices that have Google Mobile Services. Push notifications don’t work on Huawei phones.
* Flutter (Android) with FCM:
  * When the app is in the foreground state, notifications for edited and deleted messages don’t work. The original text is displayed in the notification even though the corresponding message has been edited/deleted.
* Browser notifications are not supported on mobile devices.

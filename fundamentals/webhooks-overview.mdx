CometChat Webhooks enable real-time, event-driven communication with your server by sending HTTP POST requests for specific events such as messages, user actions, group updates, calls, and moderation results.

You can use webhooks to build custom workflows such as sending SMS or email notifications, logging activity, syncing with external systems, or triggering automation.

***

## Setting Up Your Webhook Endpoint

To successfully receive and process events from CometChat, your webhook endpoint must meet the following criteria:

1. **Use HTTPS** – All webhook URLs must be secured with SSL.
2. **Be publicly accessible** – Your server should be reachable from the internet.
3. **Support POST method** – Events will be delivered as `HTTP POST` requests with `application/json` content.
4. **Return a 200 OK** – Your endpoint must acknowledge receipt by responding with `HTTP 200`.

***

## Securing Your Webhook

### Basic Authentication (Recommended)

To ensure only authorized systems can access your endpoint, use Basic Authentication:

```html
Authorization: Basic <Base64-encoded-credentials>
```

You can configure this with a username and password known only to your system.

### Token-based files access

Token-based file access provides improved control over media files through pre-signed URLs. When this feature is enabled, media URLs in webhook payloads may return a 401 Unauthorized response.

You can enable this feature in the **Settings** section under **Chats** in the CometChat dashboard. Once enabled, it cannot be disabled.

</Frame>

To access media files, use the media URL from the webhook payload to obtain a URL secured with a file access token (FAT). This URL redirects to a pre-signed URL that remains valid for 5 minutes.

**Sample request:**

```html
curl --location 'https://files-<REGION>.cometchat.io/<APP_ID>/media/audio3.mp3' \
  --header 'appId: <APP_ID>' \
  --header 'apiKey: <API_KEY>'
```

**Sample response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "url": "https://files-<REGION>.cometchat.io/<APP_ID>/media/audio3.mp3?fat=<FILE_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

## Webhook Best Practices

To maximize reliability and avoid common issues, follow these recommendations:

### 1. Handle Retries Gracefully

* Use the `retryOnFailure` flag when setting up webhooks.

* If enabled, CometChat retries failed deliveries:

  * First retry: after 10 seconds.
  * Second retry: after 30 seconds.

* Use unique event IDs from payloads to **deduplicate** retries.

### 2. Respond Quickly

* Respond within **2 seconds** to prevent timeouts.
* For long processing tasks, enqueue events to systems like **Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS**, and process them asynchronously.

### 3. Log and Monitor

* Maintain detailed logs of all incoming webhook requests and your server responses.
* Track failures, latency, and retry attempts.

### 4. Implement Robust Error Handling

* Return appropriate HTTP status codes:

  * `200 OK` for success.
  * `4xx` for client-side errors (e.g., bad request).
  * `5xx` for server-side issues.

### 5. Thoroughly Test Before Production

* Simulate various conditions: successful delivery, retries, and failures.
* Ensure your implementation handles all cases gracefully.

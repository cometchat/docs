Whether you're developing a web application, mobile app, or any other platform, our REST API offers the flexibility and scalability to meet your needs.

This documentation is structured to provide clear instructions and examples for each API endpoint, along with details on request and response formats and authentication methods. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, our goal is to make the integration process as smooth and straightforward as possible.

We're excited to see what you'll create with our CHAT APIs. Let's build something amazing together!

## Authentication

Authentication is a crucial aspect of utilizing CometChat's REST API securely. All API requests must be accompanied by an API key to authenticate the incoming requests. CometChat employs industry-standard authentication mechanisms to ensure the security and integrity of your data.

## Endpoints

CometChat's REST API offers a variety of endpoints catering to different aspects of chat functionality, including user management, messaging, groups, and many more. These endpoints are designed to be intuitive and easy to integrate into your application's backend infrastructure.

Example of a List users API request in curl command syntax:

<CodeGroup>

```powershell cURL
curl -X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "apiKey: YOUR_APIKEY_HERE" \
"https://<appId>.api-<region>.cometchat.io/v3/users"
```

</CodeGroup>

*Replace appId, apiKey and region in the curl request.*

## Sample Code

To further assist you in integrating CometChat's REST API into your application, we provide sample code snippets in popular programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, NodeJS, and PHP.

## Error codes

CometChat provides a comprehensive reference for understanding and troubleshooting various error codes that may be encountered while interacting with the API.\
Each error code is accompanied by a clear description of its meaning and potential causes, along with suggested actions to resolve or mitigate the issue.\
More about error codes can be found [here](/rest-api/constraints-rate-limits-and-errors#errors):

## Rate limits

The Rate Limits provides information about the limits on the number of API calls you can make in a certain period.\
By defining and enforcing rate limits, the API maintains optimal performance, prevents abuse, and ensures fair usage for all users.\
More about rate limits can be found [here](/rest-api/constraints-rate-limits-and-errors#rate-limits)

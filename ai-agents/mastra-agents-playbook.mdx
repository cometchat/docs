title: "Mastra Agents Playbook" 
description: "This playbook contains guides for building six core Mastra agents: Knowledge Retrieval, Frontend Action, Backend Tool Action, Handoff, Relay, and Group Chat."
---

# Knowledge Retrieval Agent

Imagine a minimal agent that can answer questions from your docs. Build a **RAG-lite retrieval agent** with local markdown files or upgrade later to a vector DB.

[See full guide in mastra-knowledge-agent.md]

---

# Frontend Action Agent

An agent that outputs structured JSON actions (navigate, openModal, toggleTheme) which your frontend dispatcher can safely execute.

[See full guide in mastra-frontend-action-agent.md]

---

# Backend Tool Action Agent

An agent that calls backend tools or APIs. Example: fetch the weather from an external API, create tickets, update CRM.

[See full guide in mastra-backend-action-agent.md]

---

# Handoff Agent

An agent that knows its limits. If a human is required, it escalates gracefully by invoking a `handoff` tool with target + reason.

[See full guide in mastra-handoff-agent.md]

---

# Relay Agent

An agent that queries multiple people, APIs, or sub-agents and returns a consolidated answer. Perfect for “Who is available tomorrow?” type queries.

[See full guide in mastra-relay-agent.md]

---

# Group Chat Agent

An agent that lives in group chats and only responds when explicitly mentioned, e.g. `@agent what’s our refund policy?`.

## Next Steps

* Combine these agents in one Mastra project.  
* Deploy to your preferred host and connect them into **CometChat Dashboard → AI Agents**.  
* Extend with guardrails, vector retrieval, and advanced workflows.  
* Distribute this playbook internally so teams can copy-paste working agent setups.

## Overview

Actions allow your AI agent to perform specific, predefined tasks during a conversation.  
Each action includes a **name**, **display name**, **execution text**, and optional **parameters** to make the execution dynamic.  

You can create actions to:

- Trigger workflows or automations.
- Call external APIs.
- Send structured responses to users.
- Execute commands with dynamic inputs.

---

## Creating an Action

1. **Navigate to AI Agent → Actions** in the CometChat dashboard.
2. Click **Create Action**.

You will see the following fields:

### **Display Name**
A human-friendly name shown in the UI.  
_Example_: `Create Support Ticket`

### **Execution Text**
The text prompt shown to the AI when this action is triggered.  
_Example_: `Create a Zendesk ticket with the following details.`

### **Name**
A unique identifier for the action. This is used programmatically and should not contain spaces.  
_Example_: `create_support_ticket`

### **Description**
A short explanation of what the action does.  
_Example_: `Creates a support ticket in Zendesk based on user query details.`

### **Parameters**
A JSON schema that defines what input values the action requires.  

**Important:** The `"<parameterName>"` must exactly match the **Tool Name** you created in **AI Agent → Tools**.  
This ensures that the Action can send correctly formatted data to the intended Tool.

Example:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "<toolName>": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Description of the parameter, defining the input the tool expects."
    }
  }
}
```

**Parameter Types:** Use standard JSON Schema types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, or `array`.

**Parameter Descriptions:** Clearly explain the purpose and expected format of each parameter.

## Best Practices

- **Keep display names short and clear** – instantly understandable to end users.
- **Use consistent naming** – for the `Name` field, use lowercase with underscores.
- **Match parameter names to tool names** – ensures correct tool invocation.
- **Validate parameters** – always define parameter types and descriptions to prevent AI misinterpretation.
- **Document purpose** – add clear descriptions for developers integrating the action.

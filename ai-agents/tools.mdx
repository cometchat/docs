## Overview

Tools allow your AI agent to perform specific operations or integrate with external systems.  
Once created, these tools can be invoked by **Actions** to execute tasks, fetch data, or interact with third-party APIs.

You can use tools to:

- Fetch data from external APIs.
- Trigger workflows in other systems.
- Perform backend logic before returning results to the chat.
- Extend your AI agent’s capabilities beyond basic responses.

## Creating a Tool

1. **Navigate to AI Agent → Tools** in the CometChat dashboard.
2. Click **Create Tool**.

You will see the following fields:

### **Display Name**
A human-friendly name shown in the UI.  
_Example_: `Zendesk Ticket Creator`

### **Execution Text**
A brief command or instruction for the AI to run when invoking this tool.  
_Example_: `Create a Zendesk support ticket using the provided details.`

### **Name**
A unique identifier for the tool. This name is critical:  
- It must match exactly when used in an **Action’s Parameters** as the `<parameterName>`.  
- Use lowercase with underscores for consistency.  
_Example_: `zendesk_ticket_creator`

## Linking Tools with Actions

When you define an **Action** that uses this tool, its `Parameters` JSON schema must include a key matching the tool’s **Name**.

Example:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "zendesk_ticket_creator": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Details required to create the ticket"
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that the Action passes the correct input to the intended tool.

## Best Practices

- **Name consistency is crucial** – mismatch between Tool Name and Action parameter key will break the link.
- **Keep execution text concise** – so the AI can easily understand the intended operation.
- **Use descriptive display names** – helpful for dashboard management.
- **Document tool requirements** – specify what input format or authentication is needed.
- **Test after creation** – trigger an Action that calls the tool to ensure it works end-to-end.

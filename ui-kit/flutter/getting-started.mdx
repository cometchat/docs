CometChat UI Kit for Flutter is a package of pre-assembled UI elements crafted to streamline the creation of an in-app chat equipped with essential messaging functionalities. Our UI Kit presents options for light and dark themes, diverse fonts, colors, and extra customization capabilities.

CometChat UI Kit supports both one-to-one and group conversations. Follow the guide below to initiate conversations from scratch using CometChat Flutter UI Kit.

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
Before installing the **UI Kit**, you need to create a CometChat application on the CometChat Dashboard, which includes all the necessary data for a chat service, such as users, groups, calls, and messages. You will require the `App ID`, `AuthKey`, and `Region` of your CometChat application when initializing the SDK.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Register on CometChat">
  You need to register on the **CometChat Dashboard** first. 
  
  <Card title="Sign Up for CometChat" icon="user-plus" href="https://app.cometchat.com/login">
    Create your account to access the CometChat Dashboard and get your application credentials.
  </Card>
</Step>

<Step title="Get Your Application Keys">
  Create a **new app** and head over to the **QuickStart** or **API & Auth Keys section** to note the **App ID**, **Auth Key**, and **Region**.
  
  <Info>
    Each CometChat application can be integrated with a single client app. Within the same application, users can communicate with each other across all platforms, whether they are on mobile devices or on the web.
  </Info>
</Step>
</Steps>

**Platform & IDE Setup**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Flutter installed on your system
- Android Studio or VS Code with configured Flutter/Dart plugins
- Xcode & Pod (CocoaPods) for iOS
- An iOS device or emulator with iOS 12.0 or above
- Android device or emulator with Android version 5.0 or above



## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Flutter application project

To get started, create a new flutter application project.

***

### Step 2: Add Dependency

<Steps>
<Step title="Update Pubspec">
  To use this UI Kit in your Flutter project, you'll need to add the following dependency to the dependencies section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:
<Accordion title="Show Code Snippet" icon="code">
  <CodeGroup>

```yaml pubspec.yaml
  cometchat_chat_uikit: ^5.0.5
  cometchat_calls_uikit: ^5.0.5 #Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
```

Final `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml pubspec.yaml
  name: getting_started
  description: "A new Flutter project."

  publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

  version: 1.0.0+1

  environment:
    sdk: ^3.5.3

  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter

    cometchat_chat_uikit: ^5.0.5 
    cometchat_calls_uikit: ^5.0.5 #Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
    cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8

  dev_dependencies:
    flutter_test:
      sdk: flutter

    flutter_lints: ^4.0.0

  flutter:
    uses-material-design: true
  ```
  
  </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
</Step>

<Step title="Android App Setup">
  To ensure compatibility with the CometChat Calling UI Kit and its dependencies, your Flutter project must target a minimum SDK version of **24 or higher**.
  
  Update the `minSdkVersion` in your Android project configuration, located at `android/app/build.gradle`:
<Accordion title="Show Code Snippet" icon="code">
  ```groovy build.gradle
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          minSdk = 24
          // Other configurations...
      }
  }
  ```
  </Accordion>
</Step>

<Step title="Update iOS Podfile">
  In your Podfile (located at ios/Podfile), update the minimum iOS version your project supports to 12.0:

  ```ruby Podfile
  platform :ios, '12.0'
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Import CometChat UIKit">
  In your Dart code, import the CometChat UIKit package to access its features. Add the following import statement to your main.dart file:

  ```dart main.dart
  import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';
  import 'package:cometchat_calls_uikit/cometchat_calls_uikit.dart'; //Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

***

### Step 3: Initialize UI Kit

Before using any features from the CometChat UI Kit, initialize it with your app credentials.

<Steps>
<Step title="Import & Configure UIKit Settings">
  You can store your app credentials (App ID, Auth Key, Region) in a dedicated configuration file and load them dynamically in your app.

  **Example Configuration File:**
<Accordion title="Show Code Snippet" icon="code">
  ```dart cometchat_config.dart
  class CometChatConfig {
    static const String appId = "APP_ID"; // Replace with your App ID
    static const String region = "REGION"; // Replace with your App Region
    static const String authKey = "AUTH_KEY"; // Replace with your Auth Key
  }
  ```
</Accordion>
  **Initialization Code:**
<Accordion title="Show Code Snippet" icon="code">
  ```dart main.dart
  import 'cometchat_config.dart';

  UIKitSettings uiKitSettings = (UIKitSettingsBuilder()
       ..subscriptionType = CometChatSubscriptionType.allUsers
       ..autoEstablishSocketConnection = true
       ..region = CometChatConfig.region
       ..appId = CometChatConfig.appId
       ..authKey = CometChatConfig.authKey
       ..extensions = CometChatUIKitChatExtensions.getDefaultExtensions() //Replace this with empty array, if you want to disable all extensions
       ..callingExtension = CometChatCallingExtension(); //Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
  ).build();

  CometChatUIKit.init(
    uiKitSettings: uiKitSettings,
    onSuccess: (successMessage) async {
      debugPrint('CometChat Initialized');
      // You can now log in the user
    },
    onError: (error) {
      debugPrint('CometChat Initialization error');
    },
  );
  ```
</Accordion>
  <Tip>
    Store your CometChat credentials in a config file to simplify environment management and avoid hardcoding.
  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

***

### Step 4: Login to UI Kit

Once the UI Kit is initialized, authenticate your user using the `login()` method. You'll receive a `User` object upon success.
<Accordion title="Show Code Snippet" icon="code">
```dart main.dart
CometChatUIKit.login(
  "cometchat-uid-1", // Replace with a valid UID
  onSuccess: (user) {
    debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn success');
  },
  onError: (error) {
    debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn error');
  },
);
```
</Accordion>
You can test using any of the following pre-generated users:

- `cometchat-uid-1`
- `cometchat-uid-2`
- `cometchat-uid-3`
- `cometchat-uid-4`
- `cometchat-uid-5`


<Info>
  For more information, refer to the documentation on [Init](/ui-kit/flutter/methods#init) and [Login](/ui-kit/flutter/methods#login-using-auth-key).
</Info>

#### Example: Initialization and Login Combined
<Accordion title="Show Code Snippet" icon="code">
```dart main.dart
import 'cometchat_config.dart';

void main() {
  UIKitSettings uiKitSettings = (UIKitSettingsBuilder()
      ..subscriptionType = CometChatSubscriptionType.allUsers
      ..autoEstablishSocketConnection = true
      ..region = CometChatConfig.region
      ..appId = CometChatConfig.appId
      ..authKey = CometChatConfig.authKey
      ..extensions = CometChatUIKitChatExtensions.getDefaultExtensions() //Replace this with empty array, if you want to disable all extensions
      ..callingExtension = CometChatCallingExtension(); //Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
  ).build();

  CometChatUIKit.init(
    uiKitSettings: uiKitSettings,
    onSuccess: (successMessage) async {
      debugPrint('CometChat Initialized');

      CometChatUIKit.login(
        "cometchat-uid-1",
        onSuccess: (user) {
          debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn success');
        },
        onError: (error) {
          debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn error');
        },
      );
    },
    onError: (error) {
      debugPrint('CometChat Initialization error');
    },
  );
}
```
</Accordion>
<Tip>
  Extract credentials into a separate file (`cometchat_config.dart`) for better maintainability.
</Tip>

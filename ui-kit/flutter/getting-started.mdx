## Prerequisites

Before installing the **UI Kit**, you need to create a CometChat application on the CometChat Dashboard, which includes all the necessary data for a chat service, such as users, groups, calls, and messages. You will require the `App ID`, `AuthKey`, and `Region` of your CometChat application when initializing the SDK.

**i. Register on CometChat**

* You need to register on the **CometChat Dashboard** first. [Click here to sign up](https://app.cometchat.com/login).

**ii. Get Your Application Keys**

* Create a **new app**
* Head over to the **QuickStart** or **API & Auth Keys section** and note the **App ID**, **Auth Key**, and **Region**.

> Each CometChat application can be integrated with a single client app. Within the same application, users can communicate with each other across all platforms, whether they are on mobile devices or on the web.

**iii. Platform & IDE Setup**

* Flutter installed on your system.
* Android Studio or VS Code with configured Flutter/Dart plugins.
* Xcode & Pod (CocoaPods) for iOS
* An iOS device or emulator with iOS 12.0 or above.
* Android device or emulator with Android version 5.0 or above.

## Getting Started

### **Step 1: Create Flutter application project**

To get started, create a new flutter application project.

***

### **Step 2: Add Dependency**

**1. Update Pubspec**

To use this UI Kit in your Flutter project, you'll need to add the following dependency to the dependencies section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml pubspec.yaml
  cometchat_chat_uikit: ^5.0.3
  cometchat_calls_uikit: ^5.0.3 #Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
```

Final `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml pubspec.yaml
  name: getting_started
  description: "A new Flutter project."

  publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

  version: 1.0.0+1

  environment:
    sdk: ^3.5.3

  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter

    cometchat_chat_uikit: ^5.0.3 
    cometchat_calls_uikit: ^5.0.3 #Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
    cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8

  dev_dependencies:
    flutter_test:
      sdk: flutter

    flutter_lints: ^4.0.0

  flutter:
    uses-material-design: true
```

***

**2. Android App Setup**

To ensure compatibility with the CometChat Calling UI Kit and its dependencies, your Flutter project must target a minimum SDK version of **24 or higher**.\
Update the `minSdkVersion` in your Android project configuration, located at `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle build.gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 24
        // Other configurations...
    }
}
```

***

**3. Update iOS Podfile**

In your Podfile (located at ios/Podfile), update the minimum iOS version your project supports to 12.0:

```ruby Podfile
platform :ios, '12.0'
```

***

4. Import CometChat UIKit In your Dart code, import the CometChat UIKit package to access its features. Add the following import statement to your main.dart file:

```dart main.dart
  import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';
  import 'package:cometchat_calls_uikit/cometchat_calls_uikit.dart'; //Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
```

***

### **Step 3: Initialize UI Kit**

Before using any features from the CometChat UI Kit, initialize it with your app credentials.

1. **Import & Configure UIKit Settings** You can store your app credentials (App ID, Auth Key, Region) in a dedicated configuration file and load them dynamically in your app.

   **Example Configuration File:**

   ```dart cometchat_config.dart
   class CometChatConfig {
     static const String appId = "APP_ID"; // Replace with your App ID
     static const String region = "REGION"; // Replace with your App Region
     static const String authKey = "AUTH_KEY"; // Replace with your Auth Key
   }
   ```

   **Initialization Code:**

   ```dart main.dart
   import 'cometchat_config.dart';

   UIKitSettings uiKitSettings = (UIKitSettingsBuilder()
        ..subscriptionType = CometChatSubscriptionType.allUsers
        ..autoEstablishSocketConnection = true
        ..region = CometChatConfig.region
        ..appId = CometChatConfig.appId
        ..authKey = CometChatConfig.authKey
        ..extensions = CometChatUIKitChatExtensions.getDefaultExtensions() //Replace this with empty array, if you want to disable all extensions
        ..callingExtension = CometChatCallingExtension(); //Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
   ).build();

   CometChatUIKit.init(
     uiKitSettings: uiKitSettings,
     onSuccess: (successMessage) async {
       debugPrint('CometChat Initialized');
       // You can now log in the user
     },
     onError: (error) {
       debugPrint('CometChat Initialization error');
     },
   );
   ```

   > Store your CometChat credentials in a config file to simplify environment management and avoid hardcoding.

***

### **Step 4: Login to UI Kit**

Once the UI Kit is initialized, authenticate your user using the `login()` method. You’ll receive a `User` object upon success.

```dart main.dart
CometChatUIKit.login(
  "cometchat-uid-1", // Replace with a valid UID
  onSuccess: (user) {
    debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn success');
  },
  onError: (error) {
    debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn error');
  },
);
```

You can test using any of the following pre-generated users:

* `cometchat-uid-1`
* `cometchat-uid-2`
* `cometchat-uid-3`
* `cometchat-uid-4`
* `cometchat-uid-5`

> For more information, refer to the documentation on [Init](/ui-kit/flutter/methods#init) and [Login](/ui-kit/flutter/methods#login-using-auth-key).

#### **Example: Initialization and Login Combined**

```dart main.dart
import 'cometchat_config.dart';

void main() {
  UIKitSettings uiKitSettings = (UIKitSettingsBuilder()
      ..subscriptionType = CometChatSubscriptionType.allUsers
      ..autoEstablishSocketConnection = true
      ..region = CometChatConfig.region
      ..appId = CometChatConfig.appId
      ..authKey = CometChatConfig.authKey
      ..extensions = CometChatUIKitChatExtensions.getDefaultExtensions() //Replace this with empty array, if you want to disable all extensions
      ..callingExtension = CometChatCallingExtension(); //Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
  ).build();

  CometChatUIKit.init(
    uiKitSettings: uiKitSettings,
    onSuccess: (successMessage) async {
      debugPrint('CometChat Initialized');

      CometChatUIKit.login(
        "cometchat-uid-1",
        onSuccess: (user) {
          debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn success');
        },
        onError: (error) {
          debugPrint('CometChat LoggedIn error');
        },
      );
    },
    onError: (error) {
      debugPrint('CometChat Initialization error');
    },
  );
}
```

> Extract credentials into a separate file (`cometchat_config.dart`) for better maintainability.

### **Step 5: Choose a Chat Experience**

Integrate a conversation view that suits your application's **UX requirements**. Below are the available options:

***

### **1️⃣ Conversation List + Message View**

**Best for:** Flutter apps that need a **smooth, stack-based navigation** between conversations and messages.

**Highlights:**

* **Compact Layout** – Uses `Navigator.push()` for mobile-first navigation.
* **One-to-One & Group Chats** – Built-in support for private and group conversations.
* **Real-Time Messaging** – Message list and view auto-refresh with CometChat events.
* **State Persistence** – Session-aware updates across screens and app restarts.
* **Mobile-First UI** – Optimized widgets that adapt to different screen sizes.
* **Extremely Customizable** – Modify styles, themes, and components easily.

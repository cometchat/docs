With Reactions, users can convey a range of emotions or express their thoughts on a particular message without typing out a full response, enhancing their user experience and fostering greater engagement.

The number of reactions displayed depends on the width of the view. For instance, if a message contains 5 reactions but the width of the CometChatReactions view can only accommodate 4 reactions at a time, the first three reactions will be shown along with an additional UI element at the end of the row. This element indicates the number of other unique reactions that are not immediately visible, informing users of the total count of different reactions.

In the example, tapping on this element (depicted as "+2" in the provided image) will by default trigger the CometChatReactionList widget. This action opens a modal sheet from the bottom of the screen, displaying all reactions received by the message.

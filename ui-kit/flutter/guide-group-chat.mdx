Learn how to create groups, join public/password groups, manage members, ban users, update roles, and transfer group ownership using CometChat UIKit for Flutter.

## Overview

Enable your users to:

- Create or join public/private/password-protected groups
- View and manage group members
- Assign roles and moderate participants
- Transfer group ownership for continuity

## Prerequisites

- **CometChat UIKit for Flutter** installed via `pubspec.yaml`
- CometChat initialized with `App ID`, `Region`, and `Auth Key`
- Group chat enabled in your CometChat app
- Navigation set up between group/member screens
- Internet permissions

## Integration Steps

### Create a Group

```dart
IconButton(
  onPressed: () {
    showCreateGroup(
      context: context,
      colorPalette: colorPalette,
      typography: typography,
      spacing: spacing,
    );
  },
  icon: Icon(Icons.group_add),
);
```

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await CometChat.createGroup(
      group: Group(
        guid: groupId,
        name: groupName,
        type: groupType,
        password: groupPassword,
      ),
      onSuccess: (Group group) => Navigator.pop(context),
      onError: (e) {
        // Show error
      },
    );
  },
  child: Text('Create Group'),
);
```

### Join Public/Password Group

```dart
CometChatGroups(
  onItemTap: (context, group) {
    JoinProtectedGroupUtils.onGroupItemTap(context, group, ...);
  },
);
```

```dart
if (group.type == GroupType.password) {
  // Show password prompt
  // Join via CometChat.joinGroup with password
}
```

### View Members

```dart
CometChatGroupInfo(
  group: group,
);
```

### Add Members

```dart
CometChatAddMembers(
  group: group,
);
```

### Ban/Unban Members

```dart
CometChatBannedMembers(
  group: group,
);
```

CometChatChangeScope(
  group: group,
  user: user,
);
```

### Transfer Ownership

```dart
CometChatTransferOwnership(
  group: group,
);
```

## Implementation Flow

1. User creates or joins a group  
2. Admin views group info and member list  
3. Admin can add, ban, change scope, or transfer ownership  

## Customization Options

- Modify theme using CometChat UIKit theming APIs
- Add logic to validate group name or enforce limits
- Adjust member filters or role options as needed

## Filtering / Edge Cases

- Filter by roles or banned status
- Prevent duplicate group IDs
- Prevent banning owner or transferring to non-member

## Error Handling & Blocked Users

- Show UI feedback (SnackBars) on failure
- Blocked users cannot be added or may be auto-banned
- Retry logic for failed actions (create, join, etc.)

## Group Type Notes

- Public: anyone can join  
- Password: prompt required  
- Private: invite-only  
- Only admins can ban, change roles, or transfer ownership

## AI Features

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Conversation Starters" icon="play">

When a user initiates a new chat, the UI kit displays a list of suggested opening lines that users can select, making it easier for them to start a conversation. These suggestions are powered by CometChat's AI, which predicts contextually relevant conversation starters.

For a comprehensive understanding and guide on implementing and using the Conversation Starters, refer to our specific guide on the [Conversation Starter](/fundamentals/ai-user-copilot/conversation-starter).

Once you have successfully activated the [Conversation Starter](/fundamentals/ai-user-copilot/conversation-starter) from your CometChat Dashboard, the feature will automatically be incorporated into the [MessageList](/ui-kit/flutter/message-list) Widget of UI Kits.

<Accordion title="Smart Replies" icon="message-square">

Smart Replies are AI-generated responses to messages. They can predict what a user might want to say next by analyzing the context of the conversation. This allows for quicker and more convenient responses, especially on mobile devices.

For a comprehensive understanding and guide on implementing and using the Smart Replies, refer to our specific guide on the [Smart Replies](/fundamentals/ai-user-copilot/smart-replies).

Once you have successfully activated the [Smart Replies](/fundamentals/ai-user-copilot/smart-replies) from your CometChat Dashboard, the feature will automatically be incorporated into the Action sheet of [MessageComposer](/ui-kit/flutter/message-composer) Widget of UI Kits.

Once you have successfully activated the [Smart Replies](/fundamentals/ai-user-copilot/smart-replies) from your CometChat Dashboard, the feature will automatically be incorporated into the Action sheet of [MessageComposer](/ui-kit/flutter/message-composer) Widget of UI Kits.

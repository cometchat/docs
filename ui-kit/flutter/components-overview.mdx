## Types of Widgets

UI Widgets, based on their behavior and functionality, can be categorized into three types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Base Widget" icon="box">
    Base Widgets form the building blocks of your app's user interface (UI).
    They focus solely on presenting visual elements based on input data,
    without handling any business logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Widget" icon="layer-group">
    Widgets build upon Base Widgets by incorporating business logic. They not
    only render UI elements but also manage data loading, execute specific
    actions, and respond to events.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Composite Widget" icon="cubes">
    Composite Widgets are advanced UI elements that combine multiple Widgets to
    achieve complex functionality, offering a sophisticated and flexible
    approach to designing UIs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Actions

Actions direct the operational behavior of a component. They are split into two categories:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Predefined Actions" icon="bolt">
    These are actions that are inherently programmed into a UI component. They
    are ingrained in the component by default and execute automatically in
    response to user interaction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User-Defined Actions" icon="user-pen">
    These are actions that must be explicitly specified by the user. They are
    not innately part of the component and must be developed based on the unique
    needs of the user or the application.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  To customize the behavior of a component, actions must be overridden. Both
  Widgets and Composite Widgets expose actions, while Base Widgets do not, as
  they are mainly responsible for rendering the UI.
</Note>

## Events & Configurations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events" icon="tower-broadcast">
    Events allow for a decoupled, flexible architecture where different parts
    of the application can interact without direct references. Both Widgets and
    Composite Widgets can emit events in response to changes or user
    interactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configurations" icon="sliders">
    Configurations offer the ability to customize the properties of each
    individual component within a Composite Component, allowing for fine-tuned
    control over its behavior and appearance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

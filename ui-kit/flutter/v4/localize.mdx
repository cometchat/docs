## Overview

CometChat UI Kit provides language localization to adapt to the language of a specific country or region. The CometChatLocalize class allows you to detect the language of your users based on their browser or device settings, and set the language accordingly.

CometChatLocalize is a class that includes methods related to locale. Developers can use these methods to change the language of the UI Kit library.

Presently, the UI Kit supports 12 languages for localization, which are:

* English (en, en-US, en-GB)
* Chinese (zh, zh-TW)
* Spanish (es)
* Hindi (hi)
* Russian (ru)
* Portuguese (pt)
* Malay (ms)
* French (fr)
* German (de)
* Swedish (sv)
* Lithuanian (lt)
* Hungarian (hu)

## Overview

The SoundManager is a helper class responsible for managing and playing various types of audio in the CometChat UI Kit. This includes sound events for incoming and outgoing messages and calls.

## Methods

### Play Sound

The SoundManager plays pre-defined or custom sounds based on user interactions with the chat interface. If no custom sound file is provided, the default sound is played.

title: "Group Members"
---

This component lists all the users who have been added or invited to participate in a particular group and have access to its discussions, shared content, and collaboration features.

Group members can engage in real-time messaging, voice calls, video calls, and other communication activities within the context of the group. They can send messages, share files, initiate or join calls, and interact with other group members based on the permissions and settings defined by the group administrator or owner.

Here are some key points related to group members:

1. Group Ownership: A group typically has an administrator or owner who has the authority to manage the group, invite or remove members, and configure group settings.
2. Member Roles and Permissions: Group members may have different roles or permissions within the group, such as participant, moderator, and admin. These roles can determine the level of access and the actions a member can perform within the group.
3. Participation and Engagement: Group members actively participate in discussions, share information, collaborate on projects, or engage in any relevant activities within the group.
4. Member Management: Group administrators, moderators or owners can add or invite new members to the group, remove existing members, or modify member roles as needed.
5. Member Notifications: Group members receive notifications about new messages, or other group activities to stay updated and engaged.

title: "Transfer Ownership"
---

This component allows the current owner or administrator of a group to transfer the ownership rights and administrative control of that group to another user. By transferring ownership, the original owner can designate a new user as the group owner, giving them full control and administrative privileges over the group.

Here are some key points regarding the transfer ownership feature in CometChat:

1. Administrative Control: The current owner or administrator of the group has the authority to initiate the transfer of ownership. This feature is typically available to ensure flexibility and allow smooth transitions of group ownership.
2. New Group Owner: During the transfer process, the current owner can select a specific user from the group members to become the new owner. This new owner will then assume the responsibilities and privileges associated with being the group owner.
3. Administrative Privileges: As the new owner, the designated user will gain full administrative control over the group. They will have the ability to manage group settings, add or remove members, moderate conversations, and perform other administrative actions.
4. Group Continuity: Transferring ownership does not disrupt the existing group or its content. The transfer ensures the continuity of the group while transferring the administrative control to a new owner.

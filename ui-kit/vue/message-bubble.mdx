This component is used to visually represent individual messages and display them in a conversation-like format.

Here are key characteristics of the message bubble:

1. Shape and Style: It is designed to visually encapsulate the content of a message.
2. Message Content: The message bubble contains the text or multimedia content of the message, such as plain text, images, emojis, or other media. It displays the actual content of the message sent by the sender.
3. Sender Information: Message bubbles includes additional information about the sender of the message, such as their name, profile picture, or timestamp. This information helps to identify who sent the message and when it was sent.
4. Layout and Placement: Message bubbles are typically arranged in a chronological order, displaying the messages in the order they were sent beginning from latest to earliest.
5. Visual Indicators: Message bubbles also includes visual indicators to convey additional information or status of the message i.e. delivered or read status indicator.

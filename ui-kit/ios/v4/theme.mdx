## Overview

The Theme is a style applied to every component of CometChat. When a style is applied as a theme, every view in the activity or every component in the UiKit will apply each property of the theme that it supports.

CometChat theme comprises two key components: Palette and Typography.

**Palette**: The Palette is a class that possesses all the color variables with their default values. It can be used to customize the color scheme of the CometChat theme, including background color, primary and secondary colors, error color, and various levels of accent colors.

**Typography**: Typography, which is also a singleton class, encompasses all the default Text Style's values. It allows you to customize the text appearances throughout the CometChat theme, such as heading, name, titles, subtitles, text, and captions.

    typography.setFont(name1: UIFont("CourierNewPSMT", size: 22))
    typography.setFont(caption1: UIFont("CourierNewPSMT", size: 15))

   // If the user wants to override the whole font family

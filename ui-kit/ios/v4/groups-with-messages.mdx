let cometChatGroupsWithMessages = CometChatGroupsWithMessages()
.setOnItemClick (onItemClick:{ group, indexPath in
//Perform Your Action
})
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

##### 2. SetOnItemLongClick

This method becomes invaluable when users seek to override long-click functionality within GroupsWithMessages, offering them enhanced control and flexibility in their interactions.

The `setOnItemLongClick` action doesn't have a predefined behavior. You can override this action using the following code snippet.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let cometChatGroupsWithMessages = CometChatGroupsWithMessages()
.setOnItemLongClick (onItemLongClick:{ group, indexPath in
//Perform Your Action

})
```

```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Filters

**Filters** allow you to customize the data displayed in a list within a Component. You can filter the list based on your specific criteria, allowing for a more customized. Filters can be applied using RequestBuilders of Chat SDK.

While the GroupsWithMessages component does not have filters, its components do, For more detail on individual filters of its component refer to [Groups Filters](/ui-kit/ios/v4/groups#filters) and [Messages Filters](/ui-kit/ios/v4/messages#filters).

By utilizing the [Configurations](#configurations) object of its components, you can apply filters.

In the following **example**, we are applying a filter to the Group List based on only joined groups and setting the limit to 3 using the `groupsRequestBuilder`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift Swift
  // You can create GroupRequestBuilder as per your requirement
let groupsRequestBuilder = GroupsRequest.GroupsRequestBuilder(limit: 3).set(joinedOnly: true)

let groupsWithMessages = CometChatGroupsWithMessages(groupsRequestBuilder: groupsRequestBuilder)

let naviVC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: groupsWithMessages)
self.present(naviVC, animated: true)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

If you are already using a navigation controller, you can use the pushViewController function instead of presenting the view controller.

</Note>

### Events

[Events](/ui-kit/ios/v4/components-overview#events) are emitted by a `Component`. By using event you can extend existing functionality. Being global events, they can be applied in Multiple Locations and are capable of being Added or Removed.

The GroupsWithMessages does not produce any events but its component does.

## Customization

To fit your app's design requirements, you have the ability to customize the appearance of the GroupsWithMessages component. We provide exposed methods that allow you to modify the experience and behavior according to your specific needs.

### Style

Using **Style** you can **customize** the look and feel of the component in your app, These parameters typically control elements such as the **color**, **size**, **shape**, and **fonts** used within the component.

##### 1. GroupsWithMessages Style 🛑

You can set the `groupsWithMessagesStyle` to the GroupsWithMessages Component to customize the styling.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift Swift
let groupsWithMessagesStyle = GroupsWithMessageStyle()
    .set(background: .init(red: 0.65, green: 0.53, blue: 0.89, alpha: 1.00))
    .set(borderColor: .systemPurple)
    .set(messageTextFont: .boldSystemFont(ofSize: 11))

let cometChatGroupsWithMessages = CometChatGroupsWithMessages()

let naviVC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: cometChatGroupsWithMessages)
self.present(naviVC, animated: true)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

If you are already using a navigation controller, you can use the pushViewController function instead of presenting the view controller.

</Note>

You can also customize its component styles. For more details on individual component styles, you can refer [Groups Styles](/ui-kit/ios/v4/groups#style) and [Messages Styles](/ui-kit/ios/v4/messages#messagesstyle).

Styles can be applied to SubComponents using their respective [configurations](#configurations).

### Functionality

These are a set of **small functional customizations** that allow you to **fine-tune** the overall experience of the component. With these, you can **change text**, set **custom icons**, and toggle the **visibility** of UI elements.

The GroupsWithMessages component currently does not offer any available functionality.

##### Components

Nearly all functionality customizations available for a Component are also available for the composite component. Using [Configuration](#configurations), you can modify the properties of its components to suit your needs.

You can find the list of all Functionality customization of individual components in [Groups](/ui-kit/ios/v4/groups#functionality) and [Messages](/ui-kit/ios/v4/messages#functionality).

**Example**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift Swift
let messagesConfiguration = MessagesConfiguration()
    .disable(disableTyping: true)
    .hide(messageHeader: true)

let groupsConfiguration = GroupsConfiguration()
    .hide(search: true)

let cometChatGroupsWithMessages = CometChatGroupsWithMessages()
    .set(messagesConfiguration: messagesConfiguration)
    .set(groupsConfiguration: groupsConfiguration)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

Ensure to pass and present `cometChatGroupsWithMessages`. If a navigation controller is already in use, utilize the pushViewController function instead of directly presenting the view controller.

</Note>

### Advanced

For advanced-level customization, you can set custom views to the component. This lets you tailor each aspect of the component to fit your exact needs and application aesthetics. You can create and define your own views, layouts, and UI elements and then incorporate those into the component.

By utilizing the [Configuration](#configurations) object of each component, you can apply advanced-level customizations to the GroupsWithMessages.

**Example**

```swift
// Create an object of  GroupsConfiguration
let groupsConfiguration = GroupsConfiguration()
.set(errorStateView: UIView)
```

**Usage**

You can utilize the groupsConfiguration object within a CometChatGroupsWithMessages widget. Simply set the groupsConfiguration using the `.set(groupsConfiguration: groupsConfiguration)` method when initializing the `CometChatGroupsWithMessages` instance.

```swift
let cometChatGroupsWithMessages = CometChatGroupsWithMessages()
.set(groupsConfiguration: groupsConfiguration)
```

To find all the details on individual Component advance customization you can refer, [Groups Advance](/ui-kit/ios/v4/groups#advanced) and [Messages Advance](/ui-kit/ios/v4/messages#advanced).

GroupsWithMessages uses advanced-level customization of both Groups & Messages components to achieve its default behavior.

1. GroupsWithMessages utilizes the [SetMenu](/ui-kit/ios/v4/groups#setmenu) function of the `Groups` subcomponent to navigate the user from [Groups](/ui-kit/ios/v4/groups) to [Messages](/ui-kit/ios/v4/messages)

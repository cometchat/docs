## Usage

### Integration

Since `CometChatCallButton` is a **custom view**, it offers flexibility in integration. It can be easily added to any view or embedded within other components, enhancing user interactions and providing seamless access to call functionalities.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let user =  User(uid: "your-uid", name: "")

let cometChatCallButton = CometChatCallButtons(width: 2, height: 4)
    cometChatCallButton.set(user: user)
    container.addSubview(cometChatCallButton)
```

</Tab>

### Actions

[Actions](/ui-kit/ios/v4/components-overview#actions) dictate how a component functions. They are divided into two types: Predefined and User-defined. You can override either type, allowing you to tailor the behavior of the component to fit your specific needs.

##### 1. SetOnVoiceCallClick

The `setOnVoiceCallClick` action is usually invoked when a voice call is initiated, executing predefined actions. However, by utilizing the provided code snippet, you can effortlessly tailor or override this default behavior to suit your unique requirements.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let cometChatCallButton = CometChatCallButtons(width: 2, height: 4)
.setOnVoiceCallClick { user, group in
//Perform Your Action
 
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

##### 2. SetOnVideoCallClick

The `setOnVideoCallClick` action is typically triggered when a video call is initiated, executing default actions. However, with the provided code snippet, you have the flexibility to easily customize or override this default behavior according to your specific preferences or requirements.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let cometChatCallButton = CometChatCallButtons(width: 2, height: 4)
.setOnVideoCallClick { user, group in
//Perform Your Action
  
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

##### 3. SetOnError

You can customize this behavior by using the provided code snippet to override the `On Error` and improve error handling.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let cometChatCallButton = CometChatCallButtons(width: 2, height: 4)
    .setOnError { error in
    //Perform Your Action

}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### Filters

**Filters** allow you to customize the data displayed in a list within a Component. You can filter the list based on your specific criteria, allowing for a more customized. Filters can be applied using RequestBuilders of Chat SDK.

The CallButton component does not have any exposed filters.

### Events

[Events](/ui-kit/ios/v4/components-overview#events) are emitted by a `Component`. By using event you can extend existing functionality. Being global events, they can be applied in Multiple Locations and are capable of being Added or Removed.

Events emitted by the Call buttons component is as follows.

| Event                      | Description                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **onOutgoingCallAccepted** | Triggers when the outgoing call is accepted. |
| **onOutgoingCallRejected** | Triggers when the outgoing call is rejected. |

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Add Listener">
```swift
// View controller from your project where you want to listen events.
public class ViewController: UIViewController {

   public override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

       // Subscribing for the listener to listen events from user module
        CometChatCallEvents.addListener("UNIQUE_ID", self as CometChatCallEventListener)
    }

}
 // Listener events from user module
extension  ViewController: CometChatCallEventListener {

    func onOutgoingCallAccepted(call: Call) {
        // Do Stuff
    }

    func onOutgoingCallRejected(call: Call){
        // Do Stuff
    }

    func onCallEnded(call: Call) {
        // Do Stuff
    }
}
```

```swift Emitting Group Events
//emit this when the other user accepts the call
CometChatCallEvents.emitOnOutgoingCallAccepted(call: Call)

//emit this when the other user rejects a call
CometChatCallEvents.emitOnOutgoingCallRejected(call: Call)

### Advanced

For advanced-level customization, you can set custom views to the component. This lets you tailor each aspect of the component to fit your exact needs and application aesthetics. You can create and define your views, layouts, and UI elements and then incorporate those into the component.

The `Call Buttons` component does not provide additional functionalities beyond this level of customization.

***

## Configurations

[Configurations](/ui-kit/ios/v4/components-overview#configurations) offer the ability to customize the properties of each individual component within a Composite Component.

* `Configurations` expose properties that are available in its individual components.

***

#### Outgoing Call

You can customize the properties of the Outgoing Call component by making use of the `OutgoingCallConfiguration`. You can accomplish this by employing the `OutgoingCallConfiguration` as demonstrated below:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
// Create an object of  OutgoingCallConfiguration
let outgoingCallConfiguration = OutgoingCallConfiguration()
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

All exposed properties of `OutgoingCallConfiguration` can be found under [Outgoing Call](/ui-kit/ios/v4/outgoing-call). Properties marked with the <Tooltip tip="Not available">🛑</Tooltip> symbol are not accessible within the Configuration Object.

**Example**

Let's say you want to change the style of the Outgoing Call subcomponent and, in addition, you only want to disable soundForCalls.

You can modify the style using the `OutgoingCallStyle` property, disable sound for calls using `.disable(soundForCalls: bool)` property.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let outgoingCallStyle = OutgoingCallStyle()
.set(subtitleColor: .black)
.set(titleColor: .orange)
.set(background: .cyan)
.set(cornerRadius: CometChatCornerStyle.init(cornerRadius: 8))

let outgoingCallConfiguration = OutgoingCallConfiguration()
.disable(soundForCalls: true)
.set(outgoingCallStyle: outgoingCallStyle)

let cometChatCallButton = CometChatCallButtons(width: 2, height: 4)
.set(outgoingCallConfiguration: outgoingCallConfiguration)
.set(user: user)
```

</Tab>

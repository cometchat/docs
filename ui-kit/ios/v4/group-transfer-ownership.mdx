title: "Transfer Ownership"

## Overview

`CometChatTransferOwnership` is a [Component](/ui-kit/ios/v4/components-overview#components) that allows the current owner or administrator of a group to transfer the ownership rights and administrative control of that group to another user. By transferring ownership, the original owner can designate a new user as the group owner, giving them full control and administrative privileges over the group.

Here are some key points regarding the transfer ownership feature in CometChat:

1. **Administrative Control**: The current owner or administrator of the group has the authority to initiate the transfer of ownership. This feature is typically available to ensure flexibility and allow smooth transitions of group ownership.
2. **New Group Owner**: During the transfer process, the current owner can select a specific user from the group members to become the new owner. This new owner will then assume the responsibilities and privileges associated with being the group owner.
3. **Administrative Privileges**: As the new owner, the designated user will gain full administrative control over the group. They will have the ability to manage group settings, add or remove members, moderate conversations, and perform other administrative actions.
4. **Group Continuity**: Transferring ownership does not disrupt the existing group or its content. The transfer ensures the continuity of the group while transferring the administrative control to a new owner.

## Usage

### Integration

`CometChatTransferOwnership`, as a custom **view controller**, offers flexible integration options, allowing it to be launched directly via button clicks or any user-triggered action. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates into tab view controllers. With banned members, users gain access to a wide range of parameters and methods for effortless customization of its user interface.

The following code snippet exemplifies how you can seamlessly integrate the TransferOwnership component into your application.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let group =  Group(guid: "your UID", name: "", groupType: .public, password: .none)
let cometChatTransferOwnership = CometChatTransferOwnership(group: group)
let naviVC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: cometChatTransferOwnership)
self.present(naviVC, animated: true)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

If you are already using a navigation controller, you can use the pushViewController function instead of presenting the view controller.

### Filters

**Filters** allow you to customize the data displayed in a list within a Component. You can filter the list based on your specific criteria, allowing for a more customized. Filters can be applied using RequestBuilders of Chat SDK.

##### 1. GroupMembersRequestBuilder

The [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/sdk/ios/retrieve-group-members) enables you to filter and customize the group members list based on available parameters in GroupMembersRequestBuilder. This feature allows you to create more specific and targeted queries when fetching groups. The following are the parameters available in [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/sdk/ios/retrieve-group-members)

| Methods              | Type      | Description                                                                                        |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **setLimit**         | Int       | sets the number of banned members that can be fetched in a single request, suitable for pagination |
| **setSearchKeyword** | String    | used for fetching banned members matching the passed string                                        |
| **setScope**         | \[String] | used for fetching group members based on multiple scopes                                           |

**Example**

In the example below, we are applying a filter to the Group Members by setting the limit to 1 and setting the scope to show only admin.

### Advance

For advanced-level customization, you can set custom views to the component. This lets you tailor each aspect of the component to fit your exact needs and application aesthetics. You can create and define your views, layouts, and UI elements and then incorporate those into the component.

#### ListItemView

Utilize this property to assign a custom ListItem to the TransferOwnership Component, allowing for enhanced customization and flexibility in its rendering.

    let statusIndicator: UIView = {
        let view = UIView()
        view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        view.backgroundColor = .systemRed
        view.layer.cornerRadius = 5

#### SubtitleView

You can set your custom Subtitle view using the `.setSubtitleView()` method. But keep in mind, by using this you will override the default Subtitle view functionality.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let group =  Group(guid: "your-uid", name: "", groupType: .public, password: .none)
let cometChatTransferOwnership = CometChatTransferOwnership(group: group)
    .setSubtitleView { groupMember in
    //Perform Your Action

}
```

  <img src="/images/3c243e57-TO_advanced_subtitle_view_screens-cd90ef04761fc716787eef65345f88fe.png" />
</Frame>

In this example, we will create a `Custom_Subtitle_GroupMember_View`a UIView file.

```swift Custom_Subtitle_GroupMember_View
import UIKit
import CometChatSDK
import CometChatUIKitSwift

class CustomSubtitleGroupMemberView: UIView {

    let memberNameLabel: UILabel = {
        let label = UILabel()

        addSubview(joinedAtLabel)

        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            memberNameLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: topAnchor),

    }


    func configure(with user: User) {
        memberNameLabel.text = "Member: \(user.name ?? "")"

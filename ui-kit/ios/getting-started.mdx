### **Install Dependencies**

This developer kit is an add-on feature to CometChat iOS SDK so installing it will also install the core Chat SDK. You can install CometChat UI Kit into your iOS project using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager (SPM).

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CocoaPods">
We recommend using CocoaPods, as they are the most advanced way of managing iOS project dependencies.

1. Create pod file by running the following command in your project's base level:

```ruby Swift
pod init
```

2. Add CometChat SDKs to Your Podfile:

```ruby Swift
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
  # CometChat UI Kit for Swift
  pod 'CometChatUIKitSwift', '5.0.6'

  # Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
  pod 'CometChatCallsSDK', '4.1.2'
end
```

3. Install the CometChat UI Kit framework through CocoaPods:

```ruby Swift
pod install
```

If you're facing any issues while installing pods, use the following command:

```ruby Swift
pod install --repo-update
```

To get the latest version of CometChat UI Kit, use:

```ruby Swift
pod update CometChatUIKitSwift
pod update CometChatCallsSDK
```

<Tip>

Always ensure to open the XCFramework file after adding the dependencies.

</Tip>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Swift Package Manager (SPM)">
**Swift Package Manager** (SPM) is Apple's built-in tool for managing dependencies in Swift projects. It allows developers to integrate and manage third-party libraries seamlessly.

1. Go to **File** tab and select **Add Package Dependencies.**

2. Enter the repository URL of the Swift package:

```
https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-uikit-ios
```

3. To add the package, select Version Rules, enter Up to Exact Version and click Add package.

   Exact Version:

   ```
   5.0.6
   ```

4. Add `CometChatSDK` repeating the above steps for following link and exact version:

   Link:

   ```
   https://github.com/cometchat/chat-sdk-ios
   ```

   Exact Version:

   ```
   4.0.62
   ```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### **Configure Privacy Permissions**

1. To enable media messaging in your app, you must allow **Camera**, **Microphone**, and **Photo Library** access in `Info.plist`. These permissions are required for sending and receiving media files.

   ```ruby Info.plist
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Allow access to the camera to capture photos and videos.</string>

   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Enable microphone access for voice and video communication.</string>

   <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Allow saving photos and videos to your device's photo library.</string>

   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Grant access to select and upload photos from your library.</string>
   ```

   </Frame>

***

### **Step 4: Initialize & Login to CometChat UI Kit**

To authenticate a user, you need a **`UID`**. You can either:

1. **Create new users** on the **[CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com)**, **[CometChat SDK Method](/ui-kit/react/methods#create-user)** or **[via the API](https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/creates-user)**.

2. **Use pre-generated test users**:

   * `cometchat-uid-1`
   * `cometchat-uid-2`
   * `cometchat-uid-3`
   * `cometchat-uid-4`
   * `cometchat-uid-5`

The **Login** method returns a **User object** containing all relevant details of the logged-in user.

***

<Note>

**Security Best Practices**

* The **Auth Key** method is recommended for **proof-of-concept (POC) development** and early-stage testing.
* For **production environments**, it is strongly advised to use an **[Auth Token](/ui-kit/ios/methods#login-using-auth-token)** instead of an **Auth Key** to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

</Note>

You can initialize CometChat and log in a user in your `SceneDelegate.swift` file:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Initialization and login are independent steps. However, the CometChat SDK **must be initialized before** you call the login method.

```swift SceneDelegate.swift highlight={13-15} lines
import UIKit
import CometChatUIKitSwift

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

        guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

        let uikitSettings = UIKitSettings()
            .set(appID: "<#Enter Your App ID Here#>")
            .set(region: "<#Enter Your Region Code Here#>")
            .set(authKey: "<#Enter Your AuthKey Here#>")
            .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
            .build()

        CometChatUIKit.init(uiKitSettings: uikitSettings) { result in
            switch result {
            case .success:
                debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit initialization succeeded")

                let uid = "cometchat-uid-1"

                CometChatUIKit.login(uid: uid) { loginResult in
                    switch loginResult {
                    case .success:
                        debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit login succeeded")

                    // ‚úÖ Option 1: Launch One-to-One or Group Chat Screen
                    // DispatchQueue.main.async { 
                    //  self.setUpOneOneOrGroupConversation(windowScene: windowScene, uid: "cometchat-uid-2")
                    // }

                    // ‚úÖ Option 2: Launch Conversation List + Message View (Split-Screen Style)
                    // DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    //  self.setupConversationsView(windowScene: windowScene)
                    // }

                    // ‚úÖ Option 3: Launch Tab-Based Chat Experience (Chats, Calls, Users, Groups)
                    // DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    //    self.setupTabbedView(windowScene: windowScene)
                    // }
            
                    case .onError(let error):
                        debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit login failed with error: \(error.description)")
                    @unknown default:
                        break
                    }
                }

            case .failure(let error):
                debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit initialization failed with error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<Info>

Ensure you replace the following placeholders with your actual CometChat credentials:

* App ID ‚Üí Your CometChat App ID
* Auth Key ‚Üí Your CometChat Auth Key
* Region ‚Üí Your App Region

These values are required for proper authentication and seamless integration.

</Info>

After running the app, you should see the following log message:

```sh Console
"CometChat UI Kit initialization succeeded"
"CometChat UI Kit login succeeded"
```

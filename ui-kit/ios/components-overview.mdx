CometChat's **UI Kit** is a set of pre-built UI components that allows you to easily craft an in-app chat with all the essential messaging features.

## Type of Components

UI components in CometChat are categorized into three types based on their **behavior** and **functionality**.
<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Base Components" icon="puzzle-piece">
    These are the **building blocks** of your UI. They **render visual elements** based on data but contain **no business logic**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Components" icon="gear-complex">
    Built on top of base components, these manage **business logic**, **data handling**, and **event responses** to create **interactive UIs**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Composite Components" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    These combine multiple components to provide **advanced, multi-functional UI features** for **richer chat experiences**.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Actions

Actions define **how a component behaves** when a user interacts with it.  
They are categorized into **two types**:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Predefined Actions" icon="square-check">
    These actions are **built into the component by default** and execute **automatically** in response to user interactions.
    <br /><br />
    **Example:** Tapping a message opens its details **without additional configuration**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="User-Defined Actions" icon="user-pen">
    These are **custom actions** created by developers to **override default behaviors** or **add new functionality** based on app-specific requirements.
    <br /><br />
    **Example:** Adding a **long-press action** to bookmark a chat.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Tip>
**Tip:** To customize component behavior, simply **override** the default actions and define your own.
</Tip>

### **Where Actions Are Available**

- **Components** and **Composite Components** → ✅ Support both **predefined** and **user-defined** actions.
- **Base Components** → ❌ Do **not** expose actions since they focus only on **UI rendering** and **do not include business logic**.

## Events

Events enable a **flexible, decoupled architecture** where different parts of the app can **communicate seamlessly** without directly referencing each other.  
This makes it easier to build **complex, interactive experiences** and extend the **CometChat UI Kit** functionality.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="What Are Events?" icon="bell">
    Events are **notifications** triggered when something **changes** or a **user interaction** occurs inside a component.  
    They help components **communicate** without tightly coupling their logic.
    <br />
    **Example:** When a new message is received, an event can **notify the message list** to update automatically.
  </Card>

  <Card title=" Event Emitters" icon="bolt">
    Both **Components** and **Composite Components** can **emit events**.  
    These events are **dispatched automatically** when:
    <br />
    - A user performs an **action** (e.g., sending a message)
    - A **state change** occurs (e.g., user comes online)
    - New **data** is received (e.g., chat updates)
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Info>
Events allow you to **listen**, **react**, and **update** your UI dynamically, making the chat experience **more responsive** and **real-time**.
</Info>

## Configurations

Configurations allow you to **customize and control** the behavior and appearance of each component within a **Composite Component**.  
They give you the flexibility to **fine-tune** individual components without affecting the entire structure.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Per-Component Customization" icon="wrench">
    Every **Composite Component** consists of multiple **individual components**.  
    Each of these components comes with its own **configuration options**, enabling you to:
    - Adjust **styling** (colors, fonts, layouts)
    - Control **functional behavior**
    - Enable or disable **specific features**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Granular Control" icon="sliders">
    Since each component exposes **separate configuration properties**, you get **fine-grained control** over:
    - How each component **looks**  
    - How it **responds to user actions**
    - How it **integrates with other components**
  </Card>
</Columns>

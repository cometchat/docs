## Overview

The `Ongoing Call` is a [Component](/ui-kit/ios/components-overview#components) that provides users with a dedicated interface for managing real-time voice or video conversations. It includes features like a video display area for video calls, call controls for mic and camera management, participant information, call status indicators, and options for call recording and screen-sharing.

## Usage

### Integration

`CometChatOngoingCall` being a custom **view controller**, offers versatility in its integration. It can be seamlessly launched via button clicks or any user-triggered action, enhancing the overall user experience and facilitating smoother interactions within the application.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
// The sessionID should be received from CometChat SDK when the call was initiated or received
let sessionID = "your_session_id"

let cometChatOngoingCall = CometChatOngoingCall()
cometChatOngoingCall.set(sessionID: sessionID)
cometChatOngoingCall.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
self.present(cometChatOngoingCall, animated: true)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

If you are already using a navigation controller, you can use the `pushViewController` function instead of presenting the view controller.

</Note>

### Actions

[Actions](/ui-kit/ios/components-overview#actions) dictate how a component functions. They are divided into two types: Predefined and User-defined. You can override either type, allowing you to tailor the behavior of the component to fit your specific needs.

##### 1. SetOnCallEnded

The `setOnCallEnded` action is typically triggered when the call is ended, carrying out default actions. However, with the following code snippet, you can effortlessly customize or override this default behavior to meet your specific needs.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let cometChatOngoingCall = CometChatOngoingCall()
.setOnCallEnded { call in
  //Perform Your Action

}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Filters

**Filters** allow you to customize the data displayed in a list within a Component. You can filter the list based on your specific criteria, allowing for a more customized. Filters can be applied using RequestBuilders of Chat SDK.

You can adjust the `callSettingsBuilder` in the `OnGoing Call` Component to customize the OnGoing Call. Numerous options are available to alter the builder to meet your specific needs. For additional details on `CallSettingsBuilder`, please visit [CallSettingsBuilder](/sdk/ios/direct-calling).

##### 1. CallSettingsBuilder

The [CallSettingsBuilder](/sdk/ios/direct-calling) enables you to filter and customize the call list based on available parameters in CallSettingsBuilder. This feature allows you to create more specific and targeted queries during the call. The following are the parameters available in [CallSettingsBuilder](/sdk/ios/direct-calling)

**Example**

In the example below, we are applying a filter to the calls.

<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callBuilder = CallSettingsBuilder()
.setAudioModeButtonDisable(true)
.setEndCallButtonDisable(false)

let cometChatOngoingCall = CometChatOngoingCall()
.set(sessionId: "Your Session ID")
.set(callSettingsBuilder: callBuilder)

cometChatOngoingCall.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
self.present(cometChatOngoingCall, animated: true)
```

</Tab>

<Warning>

Ensure to include an `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key with a descriptive string value in the app's Info.plist

### Events

[Events](/ui-kit/ios/components-overview#events) are emitted by a `Component`. By using event you can extend existing functionality. Being global events, they can be applied in Multiple Locations and are capable of being Added or Removed.

Events emitted by the Ongoing Call component is as follows.

| Event           | Description                                      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **onCallEnded** | Triggers when the ongoing or outgoing call ends. |

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Add Listener">
```swift
// View controller from your project where you want to listen events.
public class ViewController: UIViewController {

   public override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

       // Subscribing for the listener to listen events from user module
        CometChatCallEvents.addListener("UNIQUE_ID", self as CometChatCallEventListener)
    }

}
 // Listener events from user module
extension  ViewController: CometChatCallEventListener {

    func onCallEnded(call: Call) {
        // Do Stuff
    }
}
```

```swift Emitting Group Events
//emit this when logged in user cancels a call
CometChatCallEvents.emitOnCallEnded(call: Call)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Remove Listener">
```swift View Controller
public override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
      // Uncubscribing for the listener to listen events from user module
      CometChatCallEvents.removeListener("LISTENER_ID_USED_FOR_ADDING_THIS_LISTENER")
}
```

## Customization

To fit your app's design requirements, you can customize the appearance of the conversation component. We provide exposed methods that allow you to modify the experience and behavior according to your specific needs.

### Style

Using Style you can customize the look and feel of the component in your app, These parameters typically control elements such as the color, size, shape, and fonts used within the component.

The OngoingCall component does not have any exposed Styles.

***

### Functionality

These are a set of small functional customizations that allow you to fine-tune the overall experience of the component. With these, you can change text, set custom icons, and toggle the visibility of UI elements.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let cometChatOngoingCall = CometChatOngoingCall()
.set(sessionId: "Your Session ID")
.set(callWorkFlow: .defaultCalling)

cometChatOngoingCall.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
self.present(cometChatOngoingCall, animated: true)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

If you are already using a navigation controller, you can use the pushViewController function instead of presenting the view controller.

</Note>

Below is a list of customizations along with corresponding code snippets

| Property         | Description                                    | Code                      |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **CallWorkFlow** | Sets the call type to default and direct.      | `CallWorkFlow`            |
| **Session Id**   | Sets the user object for CometChatOngoingCall. | `.set(sessionId: String)` |

### Advanced

For advanced-level customization, you can set custom views to the component. This lets you tailor each aspect of the component to fit your exact needs and application aesthetics. You can create and define your views, layouts, and UI elements and then incorporate those into the component.

The `OngoingCall` component does not provide additional functionalities beyond this level of customization.

CometChat's Calls feature is a sophisticated function that facilitates the smooth integration of one-on-one and group audio-visual calling capabilities into your application, enhancing user interactivity and experience. This advanced feature is implemented effectively and efficiently in the React UI Kit.

The Calls feature allows users to communicate through high-quality voice or video calls directly within the app, supporting both individual and group interactions. It's designed to be flexible, supporting various use cases, and is easily customizable to match the look and feel of your application.

You can integrate voice and video calling SDK to add calling functionality to your CometChat-enabled application.

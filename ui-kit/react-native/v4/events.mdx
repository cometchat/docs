## Overview

Events allow for a decoupled, flexible architecture where different parts of the application can interact without having to directly reference each other. This makes it easier to create complex, interactive experiences, as well as to extend and customize the functionality provided by the CometChat UI Kit.

Both Components and Composite Components have the ability to emit events. These events are dispatched in response to certain changes or user interactions within the component. By emitting events, these components allow other parts of the application to react to changes or interactions, thus enabling dynamic and interactive behavior within the application.

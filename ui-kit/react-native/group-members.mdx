title: "Group Members"
---

## Overview

`CometChatGroupMembers` is a versatile [Component](/ui-kit/react-native/01-components-overview.md#components) designed to showcase all users who are either added to or invited to a group, thereby enabling them to participate in group discussions, access shared content, and engage in collaborative activities. Group members have the capability to communicate in real-time through messaging, voice and video calls, and various other interactions. Additionally, they can interact with each other, share files, and join calls based on the permissions established by the group administrator or owner.

## Usage

### Integration

`CometChatGroupMembers`, as a Composite Component, offers flexible integration options, allowing it to be launched directly via button clicks or any user-triggered action. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates into tab view controllers. With group members, users gain access to a wide range of parameters and methods for effortless customization of its user interface.

The following code snippet exemplifies how you can seamlessly integrate the GroupMembers component into your application.

If you're defining the Group members within the XML code, you'll need to extract them and set them on the Group object using the appropriate method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";
import { CometChatGroupsMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const [group, setGroup] = useState<CometChat.Group | undefined>(undefined);

  const getGroup = async () => {
    const group = await CometChat.getGroup("guid");
    setGroup(group);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    //login
    getGroup();
  });

  return (
    <>
      {group && <CometChatGroupsMembers group={group} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Actions

[Actions](/ui-kit/react-native/01-components-overview.md#actions) dictate how a component functions. They are divided into two types: Predefined and User-defined. You can override either type, allowing you to tailor the behavior of the component to fit your specific needs.

##### onItemPress

Function invoked when a user item is clicked, typically used to open a user profile or chat screen.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChatGroupMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";

const onPressHandler = (groupMember: CometChat.GroupMember) => {
  //code
};

return <CometChatGroupMembers onItemPress={onPressHandler} />;
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### onnItemLongPress

Function executed when a user item is long-pressed, allowing additional actions like delete or block.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChatGroupMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";

const onLongPressHandler = (groupMember: CometChat.GroupMember) => {
  //code
};

return <CometChatGroupMembers onItemLongPress={onLongPressHandler} />;
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### onBack

`OnBackPressListener` is triggered when you press the back button in the app bar. It has a predefined behavior; when clicked, it navigates to the previous activity. However, you can override this action using the following code snippet.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChatGroupMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";

const onBackHandler = () => {
  //code
};

return <CometChatGroupMembers showBackButton={true} onBack={onBackHandler} />;
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### onSelection

Called when a item from the fetched list is selected, useful for multi-selection features.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChatGroupMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";

const onSelectionHandler = (selection: Array<CometChat.GroupMember>) => {
  //code
};

return (
  <CometChatGroupMembers
    selectionMode={"single"}
    onSelection={onSelectionHandler}
  />
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### onError

This action doesn't change the behavior of the component but rather listens for any errors that occur in the Users component.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChatGroupMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";

const onErrorHandler = (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
  console.log("Error");
};

return <CometChatGroupMembers onError={onErrorHandler} />;
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### Filters

**Filters** allow you to customize the data displayed in a list within a `Component`. You can filter the list based on your specific criteria, allowing for a more customized. Filters can be applied using `RequestBuilders` of Chat SDK.

##### 1. GroupsRequestBuilder

The [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/sdk/react-native/retrieve-group-members) enables you to filter and customize the group members list based on available parameters in GroupMembersRequestBuilder. This feature allows you to create more specific and targeted queries when fetching groups. The following are the parameters available in [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/sdk/react-native/retrieve-group-members)

| Methods              | Type           | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **setLimit**         | number         | sets the number of group members that can be fetched in a single request, suitable for pagination |
| **setSearchKeyword** | string         | used for fetching group members matching the passed string                                        |
| **setScopes**        | Array\<string> | used for fetching group members based on multiple scopes                                          |

**Example**

In the example below, we are applying a filter to the Group List based on limit and scope.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";
import { CometChatGroupsMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const [group, setGroup] = useState<CometChat.Group | undefined>(undefined);
  let groupMemberRequestBuilder;

  const getGroup = async () => {
    const group = await CometChat.getGroup("mrc-uid");
    groupMemberRequestBuilder = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(
      group.getGuid()
    ).setScopes(["admin"]);
    setGroup(group);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    //login
    getGroup();
  });

  const onErrorHandler = (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
    //code
  };

  return (
    <>
      {group && (
        <CometChatGroupsMembers
          group={group}
          groupMemberRequestBuilder={groupMemberRequestBuilder}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### 2. SearchRequestBuilder

The SearchRequestBuilder uses [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/sdk/react-native/retrieve-group-members) enables you to filter and customize the search list based on available parameters in GroupMembersRequestBuilder. This feature allows you to keep uniformity between the displayed Group Members List and searched Group Members List.

**Example**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";
import { CometChatGroupsMembers } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const [group, setGroup] = useState<CometChat.Group | undefined>(undefined);
  let searchRequestBuilder;

  const getGroup = async () => {
    const group = await CometChat.getGroup("mrc-uid");
    searchRequestBuilder = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(
      group.getGuid()
    )
      .setScopes(["admin"])
      .setSearchKeyword("some-search-keyword");
    setGroup(group);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    //login
    getGroup();
  });

  return (
    <>
      {group && (
        <CometChatGroupsMembers
          group={group}
          groupMemberRequestBuilder={searchRequestBuilder}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Events

[Events](/ui-kit/react-native/components-overview#events) are emitted by a `Component`. By using event you can extend existing functionality. Being global events, they can be applied in Multiple Locations and are capable of being Added or Removed.

Events emitted by the Group Members component is as follows.

| Event                         | Description                                                       |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ccGroupMemberBanned**       | Triggers when the group member banned from the group successfully |
| **ccGroupMemberKicked**       | Triggers when the group member kicked from the group successfully |
| **ccGroupMemberScopeChanged** | Triggers when the group member scope is changed in the group      |

#### options

Defines a set of available actions that users can perform when they interact with a group member item.

* Provide actions like "View Profile", "Send Message", "Remove from Group".
* Restrict certain actions to admins (e.g., "Promote to Admin", "Ban User").

By customizing these options, developers can provide a streamlined and contextually relevant user experience

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChatGroups } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
//code

const setMyOptions = (_member: any, _group: any) => {

  <CometChatGroupMembers
    options={setMyOptions}
  />
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

#### addOptions

This method extends the existing set of actions available when users long press a group item. Unlike setOptionsDefines, which replaces the default options, addOptionsAdds allows developers to append additional actions without removing the default ones. Example use cases include:

* Adding a "Report Spam" action
* Introducing a "Save to Notes" option
* Integrating third-party actions such as "Share to Cloud Storage"

This method provides flexibility in modifying user interaction capabilities.

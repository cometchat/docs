title: "Live Data Migration"
---

Upon integrating with our messaging solution, you may encounter a scenario where your application is transitioning from a homegrown chat feature to our comprehensive services. During this transition phase, a live migration process is necessary to ensure continuity of communication.

Live migration accommodates the interaction between the legacy chat system and the new implementation. It ensures that users on different versions of your app—with some utilizing the original chat and others leveraging the latest version with CometChat integrated—can communicate seamlessly.

Implementing live migration effectively bridges the gap between the two systems during the upgrade cycle, until all users have transitioned to the updated application featuring our robust messaging capabilities.

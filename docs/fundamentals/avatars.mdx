## Extension settings

1. Login to [CometChat](https://app.cometchat.com/login) and select your app.
2. Go to the Extensions section and enable the Avatars extension.

## How does it work?

This extension allows the users to select an image for their avatar on CometChat.

Once the image file is selected for the avatar, it needs to be uploaded in the `base64` format. The extension hosts the image and updates its URL in the avatar section of the user's profile. Also, the avatar URL is sent back in the success response for being updated in your backend.

Image formats allowed by the extension are: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, svg.

Make use of the `callExtension` method provided by the CometChat SDK as shown below.

<Note>
Max size limit

The size of the Avatar image file is limited to 2 MB. Please validate the size of the image before uploading it to CometChat via this extension.

title: "Disappearing Messages"
---

The Disappearing Messages extension allows end-users to send messages that disappear after a certain interval of time. This extension works for both private (one-on-one) and group messages.

This extension is also known as exploding messages on some platforms.

## Extension settings

1. Login to [CometChat](https://app.cometchat.com/login) and select your app.
2. Go to the Extensions section and enable the Disappearing messages extension.

## How does it work?

Once the messages are sent, you can immediately schedule them for deletion using the disappearing messages extension. The message with the mentioned `msgId` gets deleted at `timeInMS`.

<Warning>

The value of timeInMS should strictly be less than 1 year

</Warning>

This extension uses the `callExtension` method provided by the CometChat SDK.

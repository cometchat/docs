## Delete a Group

To delete a group you need to use the `deleteGroup()` method. The user must be an `Admin` of the group they are trying to delete.

The `deleteGroup()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group you would like to delete |

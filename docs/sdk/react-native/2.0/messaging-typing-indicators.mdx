## Send a Typing Indicator

*In other words, as a sender, how do I let the recipient(s) know that I'm typing?*

### Start Typing

You can use the `startTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged in user has started typing. The receiver will receive this information in the `onTypingStarted()` method of the `MessageListener` class. In order to send the typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Start Typing (User)">
```javascript
let receiverId = "UID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId, receiverType);
CometChat.startTyping(typingNotification);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Start Typing (Group)">
```javascript
let receiverId = "GUID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.GROUP;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId,receiverType);
CometChat.startTyping(typingNotification);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Stop Typing

You can use the `endTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged in user has stopped typing. The receiver will receive this information in the `onTypingEnded()` method of the `MessageListener` class. In order to send the typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Stop Typing (User)">
```javascript
let receiverId = "UID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId, receiverType);
CometChat.endTyping(typingNotification);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Stop Typing (Group)">
```javascript
let receiverId = "GUID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.GROUP;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId, receiverType);
CometChat.endTyping(typingNotification);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>
Custom Data

You can use the `metadata` field of the `TypingIndicator` class to pass additional data along with the typing indicators. The metadata field is a JSONObject and can be set using the `setMetadata()` method of the `TypingIndicator` class. This data will be received at the receiver end and can be obtained using the `getMetadata()` method.

</Note>

## Real-time Typing Indicators

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when someone is typing?*

You will receive the typing indicators in the `onTypingStarted()` and the `onTypingEnded()` method of the registered `MessageListener` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Message Listener">
```javascript
let listenerId = "UNIQUE_LITENER_ID";

CometChat.addMessageListener(
  listenerId,
  new CometChat.MessageListener({
    onTypingStarted: typingIndicator => {
      console.log("Typing started :", typingIndicator);
    },
    onTypingEnded: typingIndicator => {
      console.log("Typing ended :", typingIndicator);
    }
  })
);
```

## Retrieve the List of Group Members

In order to fetch the list of groups members for a group, you can use the `GroupMembersRequest` class. To use this class i.e to create an object of the `GroupMembersRequest` class, you need to use the `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class. The `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the parameters based on which the groups are to be fetched.

The `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the below parameters:

The `GUID` of the group for which the members are to be fetched must be specified in the constructor of the `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class.

### Set Limit

This method sets the limit i.e. the number of members that should be fetched in a single iteration.

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String GUID = "GUID";
  GroupMembersRequest  groupMembersRequest = (GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  ..limit = 20
  ).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Set Search Keyword

This method allows you to set the search string based on which the group members are to be fetched.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String GUID = "GUID";
GroupMembersRequest  groupMembersRequest = (GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  ..limit = 20
  ..searchKeyword = "abc"
  ).build();
```

</Tab>

### Set Scopes

This method allows you to fetch group members based on the specified scopes.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
List<String> scopes =[];
scopes.add("admin");
scopes.add("moderator");
String GUID = "GUID";
GroupMembersRequest  groupMembersRequest = (GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  ..limit = 20
  ..scopes = scopes
  ).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Finally, once all the parameters are set to the builder class, you need to call the `build()` method to get the object of the `GroupMembersRequest` class.

Once you have the object of the `GroupMembersRequest` class, you need to call the `fetchNext()` method. Calling this method will return a list of `GroupMember` objects containing N number of members depending on the limit set.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String GUID = "GUID";
GroupMembersRequest  groupMembersRequest = (GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  ..limit = 20
  ).build();

groupMembersRequest.fetchNext(onSuccess: (List<GroupMember> groupMemberList){
    debugPrint("Group Members fetched Successfully : $groupMemberList ");  
  }, onError: (CometChatException e) {
    debugPrint("Delete Group failed with exception: ${e.message}");
  });
```

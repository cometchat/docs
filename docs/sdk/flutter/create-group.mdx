## Create a Group

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I create a public, private or password-protected group?*

You can create a group using `createGroup()` method. This method takes a `Group` object as input.

The `groupType` needs to be either of the below 3 values:

1.`CometChatGroupType.`*public* (public)

2.`CometChatGroupType.`*password* (password)

3.`CometChatGroupType.`*private* (private)

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String GUID = "GUID";
  String groupName = "Hello Group!";
  String groupType = CometChatGroupType.public;
  String password = "";

  Group _group = Group(guid: GUID, name: groupName, type: groupType);


  await CometChat.createGroup(group: _group, onSuccess: (Group group ){
    debugPrint("Group Created Successfully : $group ");
  }, onError:(CometChatException e) {
    debugPrint("Group Creation failed with exception: ${e.message}");
  } );
```

The `createGroup()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `group`   | An instance of `Group` class |

After the successful creation of the group, you will receive an instance of `Group` class which contains all the information about the particular group.

<Warning>

GUID can be alphanumeric with underscore and hyphen. Spaces, punctuation and other special characters are not allowed.

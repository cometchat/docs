title: "Login Listeners"

The CometChat SDK provides you with real-time updates for the `login` and `logout` events. This can be achieved using the `LoginListener` class provided. LoginListener consists of 4 events that can be triggered. These are as follows:

| Callback Method                     | Information                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| loginSuccess(User user)             | Informs you that the login was successful and provides you with a user object containing the data for the user that logged in                                    |
| loginFailure(CometChatException e)  | Informs you about the failure while logging in the user and provides you with the reason for the failure wrapped in an object of the `CometChatException` class  |
| logoutSuccess()                     | Informs you about the user being logged out successfully.                                                                                                        |
| logoutFailure(CometChatException e) | Informs you about the failure while logging out the user. The reason for the failure can be obtained from the object of the `CometChatException` class provided. |

To add the `LoginListener`, you need to use the `addLoginListener()` method provided by the SDK which takes a unique identifier for the listener and object of the `LoginListener` class itself.

We suggest adding the listener in the `init` method of the Stateful class or at the initialization of class where you wish to receive these events in.

```dart
class Class_Name with LoginListener {
  
  // String loginListenerId = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";
  // CometChat.addLoginListener(loginListenerId, Class_Name()); // add this in init
  @override
  void loginSuccess(User user) {
    debugPrint("LoginListener loginSuccess  $user");
  }
  
  @override
  void logoutFailure(CometChatException e) {
    debugPrint("logoutFailure ${e.message}");
  }
    
  @override
  void logoutSuccess() {
    debugPrint("LoginListener logout Success");
  }

  @override
  void loginFailure(CometChatException e) {
    debugPrint("LoginListener loginFailure  ${e.message}");
  }
}
```

In order to stop receiving events related to login and logout you need to use the `removeLoginListener()` method provided by the SDK and pas the ID of the listener that needs to be removed.

```dart
CometChat.removeLoginListener("UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID");
```

title: "Direct Calling"
---



This section will guide you to start the call/conference directly with the session id of your choice. The session id is the most important parameter as all the users joining the same session id will be connected to the same call/conference.

## Implementation

The most important class that will be used in the implementation is the `CallSettings` class. This class allows you to set the various parameters for the call/conference. In order to set the various parameters of the `CallSettings` class, you need to use the `CallSettingsBuilder` class. Below are the various options available with the `CallSettings` class.

CallSettingsBuilder class takes the 2 mandatory parameters as a part of the constructor:

1. UIView i.e a view in which you want to show the callingView inside it.
2. An object of the RelativeLayout. The calling UI will be loaded in this relative layout provided.

The other mandatory parameter is the sessionId for the call/conference. You can use the setSessionId() method of the `CallSettingsBuilder` to set the session Id of the call.

A basic example of how to start a direct call:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let sessionID = "12345" //you can set anything
let callView = // a UIView you want to show the calling view in

let callSettings = CallSettings.CallSettingsBuilder(callView: callView, sessionId:sessionID).setAudioOnlyCall(audioOnly: true).enableDefaultLayout(defaultLayout: true).build()

  CometChat.startCall(callSettings: callSettings, userJoined: { (user) in

     print("userJoined \(user)")
  }, userLeft: { (user) in

     print("userLeft \(user)")
  }, userListUpdated: { (userList) in
     
       print("userList \(userList)")
  }, audioModesUpdated: { (audioList) in
     
       print("audioList \(audioList)")             
  }, onUserMuted: {onUserMuted in 
  		print("onUserMuted \(onUserMuted)")                    
  }, onCallSwitchedToVideo: {callSwitchVideo in
  		print("callSwitchVideo \(callSwitchVideo)")                          
  }, onRecordingStarted: {onRecordingStarted in 
  		print("onRecordingStarted \(onRecordingStarted)")  
  }, onRecordingStopped: {onRecordingStopped in 
  		print("onRecordingStopped \(onRecordingStopped)")  
	}, onError: { (error) in

      print("OnError \(error!.errorDescription)")
  }) { (call) in

      print("onCallended \(call)")
  }
```

The `setAudioOnlyCall()` method allows you to set if the call is supposed to be an audio call or an audio-video call. If set to true, the call will be an audio-only call else when set to false the call will be an audio-video call. The default will is false, so if not set, the call will be an audio-video call.

| Parameter   | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`      | The view that you want to show the calling view in.  |
| `sessionID` | The unique session ID available in the `Call` object |

The `OngoingCallListener` listener provides you with the below callback methods:

| Callback Method         | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Settings

The `CallSettings` class is the most important class when it comes to the implementation of the Calling feature. This is the class that allows you to customize the overall calling experience. The properties for the call/conference can be set using the `CallSettingsBuilder` class. This will eventually give you and object of the `CallSettings` class which you can pass to the `startCall()` method to start the call.

The **mandatory** parameters that are required to be present for any call/conference to work are:

1. UIView i.e a view in which you want to show the callingView inside it.
2. An object of the RelativeLayout. The calling UI will be loaded in this relative layout provided.

The options available for customization of calls are:

In case you wish to achieve a completely customized UI for the Calling experience, you can do so by embedding default android buttons to the screen as per your requirement and then use the below methods to achieve different functionalities for the embedded buttons.

For the use case where you wish to align your own custom buttons and not use the default layout provided by CometChat, you can embed the buttons in your layout and use the below methods to perform the corresponding operations:

#### Switch Camera

Switch Camera You can call `switchCamera()` Method to toggle between camera sources.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.switchCamera()
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Mute Audio

You can call `muteAudio()` Method to mute your Audio Stream to the end-user.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.muteAudio(mute: true) //toggle this value for unmuting the user's audio
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If set to `true` the Audio Stream is muted and if set to`false` Audio Stream is transmitted.

### Pause Video

Pause Video You can call `pauseVideo()` Method to pause Video Stream to the end-user.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.pauseVideo(pauseVideo: true) //toggle this value for resuming the user's video
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If set to `true` the Video Stream is muted and if set to`false` Video Stream is transmitted.

### Audio Mode

Set Audio Mode You can call `setAudioMode()` to set the output of the audio stream.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.audioMode(setAudioMode: .EARPIECE)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The audio mode can have either one of the below 4 values:

* SPEAKER
* EARPIECE
* BLUETOOTH
* HEADPHONES

### End Call

You can use the `CometChat.endCall()` method of the `CometChat` class to end the call.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
var sessionID = "" // sessionId of the call

CometChat.endCall(sessionID: sessionID, onSuccess: { (call) in
            
    print("Call Ended Successfully")
}) { (error) in

    print("Error in ending the call \(error?.errorDescription)")
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Get list of available audio modes

This method will return the list of available audio modes. Based on the list received, you can set the audio mode for the ongoing call using the `setAudioMode()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.getAudioModes { (modes) in
	print("Available audio modes received \(modes)")
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The AudioMode class has the below properties:

1. mode - The mode can be either one of the below values:

* SPEAKER
* EARPIECE
* BLUETOOTH
* HEADPHONES

2. isSelected - This is a boolean value that indicates if the audio mode is the active mode.

<Warning>

The `CometChat.getActiveCall()` method in case of Direct Calling will return nil and all the details related to the call session will have to be saved and maintained at your end.

</Warning>

## Call Participant Count

In order to get the number of participants in any call, you can use the `getCallParticipantCount()` method. This method takes the session id of the call and returns the number of participants that are active in the call.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let sessionID = "12345"

 CometChat.getCallParticipantCount(sessionId: "", type: .DIRECT, onSucces:  {
      (count) in
      print("Count \(count)")
 }, onError: { (error) in
      print("OnError \(error?.errorDescription)")
 })
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
// To switch Camera from front to rear and vice versa. 
[CometChatCalls switchCamera];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

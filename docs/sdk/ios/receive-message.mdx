title: "Receive A Message"
---



Receiving messages with CometChat has two parts:

1. Adding a listener to receive [real-time messages](/docs/sdk/ios/receive-message#real-time-messages) when your app is running
2. Calling a method to retrieve [missed messages](/docs/sdk/ios/receive-message#missed-messages) when your app was not running

## Real-time Messages

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I receive messages when my app is running?*

In order to receive incoming messages, you must add protocol conformance `CometChatMessageDelegate` as Shown Below :

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
extension ViewController: CometChatMessageDelegate {

  func onTextMessageReceived(textMessage: TextMessage) {

    print("TextMessage received successfully: " + textMessage.stringValue())
  }

  func onMediaMessageReceived(mediaMessage: MediaMessage) {

    print("MediaMessage received successfully: " + mediaMessage.stringValue())
  }

  func onCustomMessageReceived(customMessage: CustomMessage) {

    print("CustomMessage received successfully: " + customMessage.stringValue())
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
@interface ViewController ()<CometChatMessageDelegate>
@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    CometChat.messagedelegate = self ;
}

- (void)onTextMessageReceivedWithTextMessage:(TextMessage *)textMessage {

    NSLog(@"TextMessage received successfully: %@",[textMessage stringValue]);
}

- (void)onMediaMessageReceivedWithMediaMessage:(MediaMessage *)mediaMessage {

    NSLog(@"MediaMessage received successfully: %@",[mediaMessage stringValue]);
}

- (void)onCustomMessageReceivedWithCustomMessage:(CustomMessage *)customMessage {

  	NSLog(@"CustomMessage received : %@",[customMessage stringValue]);
}

@end
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Do not forget to set your view controller as a CometChat delegate probably in `viewDidLoad()` as `CometChat.messagedelegate = self`

<Warning>

As a sender, you will not receive your own message in a real-time message event. However, if a user is logged-in using multiple devices, they will receive an event for their own message in other devices.

</Warning>

## Missed Messages

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I receive messages that I missed when my app was not running?*

For most cases, you will need to add functionality to load missed messages. If you're building an on-demand or live streaming app, you may choose to skip this and fetch message history instead.

Using the same `MessagesRequest` class and the filters provided by the `MessagesRequestBuilder` class, you can fetch the message that we sent to the logged-in user but were not delivered to him as he was offline. For this, you will require the Id of the last message received. You can either maintain it at your end or use the `getLastDeliveredMessageId()` method provided by the CometChat class. This Id needs to be passed to the `setMessageId()` method of the builder class.

Now using the `fetchNext()` method, you can fetch all the messages that were sent to the user when he/she was offline.

Calling the `fetchNext()` method on the same object repeatedly allows you to fetch all the offline messages for the logged in user in a paginated manner

### Fetch Missed Messages of a particular one-on-one conversation

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let limit = 50;
let latestId = CometChat.getLastDeliveredMessageId()
let UID = "cometchat-uid-2"

let messagesRequest = MessagesRequest.MessageRequestBuilder().set(messageID: latestId).set(uid:UID).set(limit: limit).build();

messagesRequest.fetchNext(onSuccess: { (messages) in

 for message in messages!{

    if let receivedMessage = (message as? TextMessage) {
      print("Message received successfully. " + receivedMessage.stringValue())
    }
    else if let receivedMessage = (message as? MediaMessage) {
      print("Message received successfully. " + receivedMessage.stringValue())
  	}
  }

}) { (error) in

  print("Message receiving failed with error: " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSInteger limit = 50;
NSString *latestMessageId = [CometChat getLatestDeliveredMessageId];

MessagesRequest *messageRequest = [[[[[MessageRequestBuilder alloc]init] setWithMessageID: latestMessageId] setWithLimit:limit] build];

      }
      else if ([messages isKindOfClass:MediaMessage.self]) {

          MediaMessage *receivedMessage = (MediaMessage *)message;
          NSLog(@"MediaMessage received successfully. %@",[receivedMessage stringValue]);
      }
  }

} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {

	NSLog(@"Message receiving failed with error: %@",[error ErrorDescription]);

}];
```

}];
```

## Unread Messages

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I fetch the messages I've not read?*

Using the `MessagesRequest` class described above, you can fetch the unread messages for the logged-in user. In order to achieve this, you need to set the `unread` variable in the builder to `true` using the `setUnread()` method so that only the unread messages are fetched.

<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let limit = 50;

<Note>
BaseMessage

The list of messages received is in the form of objects of `BaseMessage` class. A BaseMessage can either be a `TextMessage` or a `MediaMessage`. You can use the `instanceOf` operator to check the type of object.

</Note>

## Message History

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I fetch the complete message history?*

### Fetch Message History of a particular one-on-one conversation

Using the `MessagesRequest` class and the filters for the `MessagesRequestBuilder` class as shown in the below code snippet, you can fetch the entire conversation between the logged in user and any particular user. For this use case, it is mandatory to set the UID parameter using the `setUID()` method of the builder. This UID is the unique id of the user for which the conversation needs to be fetched.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let limit = 50;
let UID = "cometchat-uid-2"

let messagesRequest = MessagesRequest.MessageRequestBuilder().set(limit: limit).set(uid:UID).build();

  for message in messages!{

    if let receivedMessage = (message as ? TextMessage) {
      print("Message received successfully. " + receivedMessage.stringValue())
    }
    else if let receivedMessage = (message as ? MediaMessage) {
      print("Message received successfully. " + receivedMessage!.stringValue())

	NSLog(@"Message receiving failed with error: %@",[error ErrorDescription]);

}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Calling the `fetchPrevious()` method on the same object repeatedly allows you to fetch all the previous messages in a paginated way.

### Fetch Message History of a particular group conversation

Using the `MessagesRequest` class and the filters for the `MessagesRequestBuilder` class as shown in the below code snippet, you can fetch the entire conversation for any group provided you have joined the group. For this use case, it is mandatory to set the GUID parameter using the `setGUID()` method of the builder. This GUID is the unique identifier of the Group for which the messages are to be fetched.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let limit = 50;
let GUID = "cometchat-guid-1"

Calling the `fetchPrevious()` method on the same object repeatedly allows you to fetch the entire conversation between the logged in user and the specified user. This can be implemented with upward scrolling to display the entire conversation.

## Search Messages

In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I search a message?

In order to do this, you can use the `set(searchKeyword: String)` method. This method accepts string as input. When set, the SDK will fetch messages which match the `searchKeyword`.

<Note>

By default, the searchKey is searched only in message text. However, if you enable `Conversation & Advanced Search`, the searchKey will be searched in message text, file name, mentions & mime type of the file.

The `Conversation & Advanced Search` is only available in `Advanced` & `Custom` [plans](https://www.cometchat.com/pricing). If you're already on one of these plans, please enable the `Conversation & Advanced Search` from [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com) (Open your app, navigate to Chats -> Settings -> General Configuration)

</Note>

| Feature          | Basic Search | Advance Search |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Text search      | ✅            | ✅              |
| File name search | ❌            | ✅              |
| Mentions search  | ❌            | ✅              |
| Mime type search | ❌            | ✅              |

## Unread Messages Count

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I find out the number of unread messages that I have?*

### Fetch Unread Message Count of a particular one-on-one conversation

*In other words, how do I find out the number of unread messages I have from a particular user?*

In order to get the unread message count for a particular user (with respect to the logged-in user), you can use the `getUnreadMessageCountForUser()`.

This method has the two variants:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.getUnreadMessageCountForUser(UID)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If you wish to ignore the messages from blocked users you can use the below syntax setting the boolean parameter to true:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.getUnreadMessageCountForUser(UID, hideMessagesFromBlockedUsers:true)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let UID = "cometchat-uid-1"

CometChat.getUnreadMessageCountForUser(UID, onSuccess: { (response) in

    print("Unread count for users: \(response)")

}) { (error) in

    print("Error in unread count for users: \(error)")
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

In the `onSuccess()` callback, you will receive a dictionary that will contain the UID of the user as the key and the unread message count as the value.

### Fetch Unread Message Count of a particular group conversation

In order to get the unread message count for a particular group, you can use the `getUnreadMessageCountForGroup()`. This method has the below two variants:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">

CometChat.getUnreadMessageCountForGroup(GUID)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If you wish to ignore the messages from blocked users you can use the below syntax setting the boolean parameter to true:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.getUnreadMessageCountForGroup(GUID, hideMessagesFromBlockedUsers:true)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift

}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

In the `onSuccess()` callback, you will receive a dictionary that will contain the GUID of the group as the key and the unread message count as the value.

### Fetch Unread Message Count of all one-on-one & group conversation

*In other words, how do I find out the number of unread messages for every one-on-one and group conversation?*

In order to get all the unread message counts, you can use the `getUnreadMessageCount()` method. This method has two variants:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.getUnreadMessageCount(callbacks)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If you wish to ignore the messages from blocked users you can use the below syntax setting the boolean parameter to true:

</Tab>

</Tabs>

In the `onSuccess()` callback, you will receive a dictionary having two keys:

1. user - The value for this key holds another dictionary that holds the UIDs of the users and their corresponding unread message counts
2. group - The value for this key holds another dictionary that holds the GUIDs of the groups and their corresponding unread message counts

### Fetch Unread Message Count of all one-on-one conversation

*In other words, how do I find out the number of unread messages I have for every user?*

In order to fetch the unread message counts for just the users, you can use the `getUnreadMessageCountForAllUsers()` method.

This method, just like others, has two variants:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.getUnreadMessageCountForAllUsers(callbacks)

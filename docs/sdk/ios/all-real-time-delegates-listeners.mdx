CometChat provides 4 listeners (Delegates) viz.

1. [User Delegate (Listener)](/docs/sdk/ios/all-real-time-delegates-listeners#user-delegate-methods)
2. [Group Delegate (Listener)](/docs/sdk/ios/all-real-time-delegates-listeners#group-delegate-methods)
3. [Message Delegate (Listener)](/docs/sdk/ios/all-real-time-delegates-listeners#message-delegate-methods)
4. [Call Delegate (Listener)](/docs/sdk/ios/all-real-time-delegates-listeners#call-delegate-methods)

## User Delegate Methods

The `CometChat` provides you with live events related to users. Below are the callback methods provided by the `CometChatUserDelegate`.

| Delegate Method                | Information                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onUserOnline(user: User)**   | This method is triggered when a user comes online and is available to chat. The details of the user can be obtained from the user object received as the method parameter. |
| **onUserOffline(user: User)**: | This method is triggered when a user goes offline. The details of the user can be obtained from the User object received as the parameter.                                 |

In order to use the Delegate methods you must add protocol conformance `CometChatUserDelegate` as Shown Below:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
extension ViewController : CometChatUserDelegate {

    func onUserOnline(user: User) {
      print(user.stringValue() + " status becomes online.")
    }

    func onUserOffline(user: User) {
      print(user.stringValue() + " status becomes offline.")
    }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
@interface ViewController ()<CometChatUserDelegate>

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [CometChat setUserdelegate:self];
}

- (void)onUserOfflineWithUser:(User * _Nonnull)user {
    NSLog(@"%@ status becomes offline.",[user stringValue]);
}

- (void)onUserOnlineWithUser:(User * _Nonnull)user {

    NSLog(@"%@ status becomes online.",[user stringValue]);
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

**Do not forget to set your view controller as a CometChat delegate probably in `viewDidLoad()` as `CometChat.userdelegate = self`**

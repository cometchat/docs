## Send a Typing Indicator

*In other words, as a sender, how do I let the recipient(s) know that I'm typing?*

### Start Typing

You can use the `startTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged-in user has started typing. The receiver will receive this information in the `onTypingStarted()` method of the `CometChatMessageDelegate` protocol conformance. In order to send the typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let typingIndicator = TypingIndicator(receiverID: "receiverUID", receiverType: .user)

CometChat.startTyping(indicator: typingIndicator)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
TypingIndicator *typingIndicator = [[TypingIndicator alloc]initWithReceiverID:@"receiverID" receiverType: ReceiverTypeUser metadata:nil];

[CometChat startTypingWithIndicator:typingIndicator];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Stop Typing

You can use the `endTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged-in user has stopped typing. The receiver will receive this information in the `onTypingEnded()` method of the `CometChatMessageDelegate` protocol conformance. In order to send the typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let typingIndicator = TypingIndicator(receiverID: "receiverUID", receiverType: .user)

CometChat.endTyping(indicator: typingIndicator)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
TypingIndicator *typingIndicator = [[TypingIndicator alloc]initWithReceiverID:@"receiverID" receiverType: ReceiverTypeUser metadata:nil];

[CometChat endTypingWithIndicator:typingIndicator];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>
Custom Data

You can use the `metaData` field of the `TypingIndicator` class to pass additional data along with the typing indicators. A metaData field is a dictionary and this property can be set from `TypingIndicator` class. This data will be received at the receiver end and can be obtained using the `metaData` property.

## Real-time Typing Indicators

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when someone is typing?*

You will receive the typing indicators in the `onTypingStarted()` and the `onTypingEnded()` method of the `CometChatMessageDelegate`. In order to receive typing indicators, you must add protocol conformance `CometChatMessageDelegate`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
extension ViewController: CometChatMessageDelegate {

  func onTypingStarted(_ typingDetails : TypingIndicator) {

    print("Typing started received successfully")
  }

  func onTypingEnded(_ typingDetails : TypingIndicator) {

    print("Typing ended received successfully")
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
@interface ViewController ()<CometChatMessageDelegate>

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    CometChat.messagedelegate = self ;
}

- (void)onTypingStarted:(TypingIndicator *)typingDetails {
    NSLog(@"Typing started received successfully");
}

- (void)onTypingEnded:(TypingIndicator *)typingDetails {
    NSLog(@"Typing ended received successfully");
}

@end
```

The `TypingIndicator` class consists of the below parameters:

| Parameter    | Information                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sender       | An object of the `User` class holding all the information. related to the sender of the typing indicator.                                                                        |
| receiverId   | unique Id of the receiver. This can be the Id of the group or the user the typing indicator is sent to.                                                                          |
| receiverType | This parameter indicates if the typing indicator is to be sent to a user or a group. The possible values are: 1. `CometChat.ReceiverType.user` 2. `CometChat.ReceiverType.group` |
| metaData     | A Dictionary to provide additional data                                                                                                                                          |

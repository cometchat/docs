## Overview

CometChat UIKit for iOS enables developers to integrate customizable components into their applications effortlessly. Each component is designed to ensure a consistent user experience, offering flexibility to align with your app’s design system. You can modify attributes such as colors, fonts, sizes, and more using CometChatTheme or directly applying styles to components.

Below is a detailed guide for styling individual components within the UIKit.

## Overview

`CometChatQuickReactions` is a component designed to display a row of reactions that users can apply to messages. Initially, it shows favorite reactions along with a plus icon. Tapping the plus icon opens the CometChatEmojiKeyboard, providing access to a broader range of reactions. Selecting a reaction from the keyboard or the favorite reactions list automatically applies it to the respective message.

The quick reactions list can have a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5 reactions.

This component is typically activated by long-pressing a message bubble in the message list.

The `onReactionPress` action is activated when an emoji is pressed from the `QuickReactions` List.

<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat/chat-sdk-react-native";
import { CometChatQuickReactions } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const onQuickReactionPressHandler = (emoji: string) => {
    //code
  };

  return (
    <CometChatQuickReactions onReactionPress={onQuickReactionPressHandler}>

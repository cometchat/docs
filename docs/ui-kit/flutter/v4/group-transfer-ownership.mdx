## Overview

`CometChatTransferOwnership` is a [Widget](/docs/ui-kit/flutter/v4/components-overview#components) that allows the current owner or administrator of a group to transfer the ownership rights and administrative control of that group to another user. By transferring ownership, the original owner can designate a new user as the group owner, giving them full control and administrative privileges over the group.

`CometChatTransferOwnership` is a [Widget](/docs/ui-kit/flutter/v4/components-overview#components) that allows the current owner or administrator of a group to transfer the ownership rights and administrative control of that group to another user. By transferring ownership, the original owner can designate a new user as the group owner, giving them full control and administrative privileges over the group.

Here are some key points regarding the transfer ownership feature in CometChat:

1. **Administrative Control**: The current owner or administrator of the group has the authority to initiate the transfer of ownership. This feature is typically available to ensure flexibility and allow smooth transitions of group ownership.
2. **New Group Owner**: During the transfer process, the current owner can select a specific user from the group members to become the new owner. This new owner will then assume the responsibilities and privileges associated with being the group owner.
3. **Administrative Privileges**: As the new owner, the designated user will gain full administrative control over the group. They will have the ability to manage group settings, add or remove members, moderate conversations, and perform other administrative actions.
4. **Group Continuity**: Transferring ownership does not disrupt the existing group or its content. The transfer ensures the continuity of the group while transferring the administrative control to a new owner.

### Actions

[Actions](/docs/ui-kit/flutter/v4/components-overview#actions) dictate how a widget functions. They are divided into two types: Predefined and User-defined. You can override either type, allowing you to tailor the behavior of the widget to fit your specific needs.

##### 1. onTransferOwnership

This is a callback function that is triggered when the ownership of a group is transferred. It takes two parameters: a GroupMember object representing the new owner of the group, and a Group object representing the group whose ownership is being transferred.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChatTransferOwnership(
  group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
  onTransferOwnership: (groupMember, group) {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  },
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

##### 2. onBack

Enhance your application's functionality by leveraging the `onBack` feature. This capability allows you to customize the behavior associated with navigating back within your app. Utilize the provided code snippet to override default behaviors and tailor the user experience according to your specific requirements.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChatTransferOwnership(
  group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
  onBack: () {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  },
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### 3. onError

You can customize this behavior by using the provided code snippet to override the `onError` and improve error handling.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChatTransferOwnership(
  group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
  onError: (e) {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  },
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### Filters

**Filters** allow you to customize the data displayed in a list within a Widget. You can filter the list based on your specific criteria, allowing for a more customized. Filters can be applied using RequestBuilders of Chat SDK.

##### 1. GroupMembersRequestBuilder

The [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/docs/sdk/flutter/retrieve-group-members) enables you to filter and customize the group members list based on available parameters in `GroupMembersRequestBuilder`. This feature allows you to create more specific and targeted queries when fetching groups. The following are the parameters available in [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/docs/sdk/flutter/retrieve-group-members)

| Property           | Description                                                                                 | Code                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Guid**           | Group ID for the group whose members are to be fetched                                      | `guid: String`           |
| **Limit**          | Sets the number of members that can be fetched in a single request, suitable for pagination | `limit: int?`            |
| **Search Keyword** | Keyword for searching                                                                       | `searchKeyword: String?` |
| **Scopes**         | Used for fetching group members based on multiple scopes                                    | `scopes: List<String>?`  |

**Example**

In the example below, we are applying a filter to the members by setting the limit to 10.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChatTransferOwnership(
    group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
    groupMembersRequestBuilder: GroupMembersRequestBuilder("guid")
      ..limit = 10
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### 2. CustomTransferOwnershipProtocol

The SearchRequestBuilder uses [GroupMembersRequestBuilder](/docs/sdk/flutter/retrieve-group-members) enables you to filter and customize the search list based on available parameters in `GroupMembersRequestBuilder`. This feature allows you to keep uniformity between the displayed Group Members List and searched Group Members List.

**Example**

This feature allows you to keep uniformity between the displayed Members list and searched Members.

**Example**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart custom_protocol.dart
import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';

class CustomTransferOwnershipProtocol extends GroupMembersBuilderProtocol {
  const CustomTransferOwnershipProtocol(super.builder);

  @override
  GroupMembersRequest getRequest() {
      return requestBuilder.build();
  }

  @override
  GroupMembersRequest getSearchRequest(String val) {
      requestBuilder.searchKeyword = val;
      return requestBuilder.build();
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart main.dart
CometChatTransferOwnership(
  group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
  groupMembersProtocol: CustomTransferOwnershipProtocol(GroupMembersRequestBuilder("")..searchKeyword = "searchKeyword"),
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Events

[Events](/docs/ui-kit/flutter/v4/components-overview#events) are emitted by a `Widget`. By using event you can extend existing functionality. Being global events, they can be applied in Multiple Locations and are capable of being Added or Removed.

Events emitted by the Join Group widget is as follows.

| Event                  | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ccOwnershipChanged** | Triggers when the ownership of a group member is changed successfully |

**Example**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class YourScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const YourScreen({super.key});

  @override
  State<YourScreen> createState() => _YourScreenState();
}

class _YourScreenState extends State<YourScreen> with CometChatGroupEventListener {

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    CometChatGroupEvents.addGroupsListener("listenerId", this); // Add the listener
  }

  @override
  void dispose(){
    super.dispose();
    CometChatGroupEvents.removeGroupsListener("listenerId"); // Remove the listener
  }

  @override
  void ccOwnershipChanged(Group group, GroupMember newOwner) {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }

### Advance

For advanced-level customization, you can set custom views to the widget. This lets you tailor each aspect of the widget to fit your exact needs and application aesthetics. You can create and define your own widget and then incorporate those into the widget.

#### ListItemView

With this function, you can assign a custom ListItem to the `CometChatTransferOwnership` Widget.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart widget
CometChatTransferOwnership(
  group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
  listItemView: (groupMember) {
    return Placeholder(); // Replace this placeholder with your custom widget.
  },
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Here is the complete example for reference:

**Example**

You can indeed create a custom widget named `custom_list_item.dart` for more complex or unique list items.

  final String name;
  final DateTime? lastMessageTime;
  final String? avatarUrl;

  const CustomListItems({
    super.key,
    required this.name,
    this.lastMessageTime,
    this.avatarUrl,
  });

  String formatDateTime(DateTime dateTime) {
    final now = DateTime.now();
    final difference = now.difference(dateTime);

    if (difference.inDays == 0) {
      return DateFormat('HH:mm').format(dateTime);
    } else if (difference.inDays == 1) {
      return 'Yesterday';
    } else {

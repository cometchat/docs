## Overview

`CometChatGroupMembers` is a versatile [Widget](/docs/ui-kit/flutter/components-overview#components) designed to showcase all users who are either added to or invited to a group, thereby enabling them to participate in group discussions, access shared content, and engage in collaborative activities. `CometChatGroupMembers` have the capability to communicate in real-time through messaging, voice and video calls, and various other interactions. Additionally, they can interact with each other, share files, and join calls based on the permissions established by the group administrator or owner.

##### 5. onSelection

When the `onSelection` event is triggered, it furnishes the list of selected members. This event can be invoked by any button or action within the interface. You have the flexibility to implement custom actions or behaviors based on the selected members.

This action does not come with any predefined behavior. However, you have the flexibility to override this event and tailor it to suit your needs using the following code snippet.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChatGroupMembers(
  group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
  selectionMode: SelectionMode.multiple,
  activateSelection: ActivateSelection.onClick,
  onSelection: (groupMembersList) {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  },
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### onLoad

Invoked when the list is successfully fetched and loaded, helping track component readiness..

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChatGroupMembers(
     onLoad: (list) {
          // print("members loaded: ${list.length}");
        },
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

##### onEmpty

Called when the list is empty, enabling custom handling such as showing a placeholder message.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">

        },
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Filters

**Filters** allow you to customize the data displayed in a list within a `Widget` . You can filter the list based on your specific criteria, allowing for a more customized. Filters can be applied using `RequestBuilders` of Chat SDK.

##### 1. GroupMembersRequestBuilder

| Property           | Description                                              | Code                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **GUID**           | Group ID for the group whose members are to be fetched.  | `guid: String`           |
| **Limit**          | Number of results to limit the query.                    | `limit: int?`            |
| **Search Keyword** | Keyword for searching members within the group.          | `searchKeyword: String?` |
| **Scopes**         | List of scopes for filtering members (e.g., moderators). | `scopes: List<String>?`  |

**Example**

In the example below, we are applying a filter to the Group List based on limit and scope.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChatGroupMembers(
    group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
    groupMembersRequestBuilder: GroupMembersRequestBuilder("")
      ..limit = 10
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

##### 2. GroupMembersProtocol

The `GroupMembersProtocol` uses [GroupsRequestBuilder](/docs/sdk/flutter/retrieve-groups) enables you to filter and customize the search list based on available parameters in GroupsRequestBuilder.

This feature allows you to keep uniformity between the displayed Group Members List and Searched Group Members List.

Here is the complete example for reference:

**Example**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart custom_protocol_builder.dart
import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';

class CustomProtocolBuilder extends GroupMembersBuilderProtocol {
  const CustomProtocolBuilder(super.builder);

  @override
  GroupMembersRequest getRequest() {
      return requestBuilder.build();
  }

  @override
  GroupMembersRequest getSearchRequest(String val) {
      requestBuilder.searchKeyword = val;
      return requestBuilder.build();
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart main.dart
CometChatGroupMembers(
  group: Group(guid: "", name: "", type: ""), // A group object is required to launch this widget.
  groupMembersProtocol: CustomProtocolBuilder(GroupMembersRequestBuilder("")..searchKeyword = "searchKeyword"),
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### Events

[Events](/docs/ui-kit/flutter/components-overview#events) are emitted by a `Widget` . By using event you can extend existing functionality. Being global events, they can be applied in Multiple Locations and are capable of being Added or Removed.

Events emitted by the Join Group widget is as follows.

| Event                         | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ccGroupMemberBanned**       | Triggers when the group member banned from the group successfully |
| **ccGroupMemberKicked**       | Triggers when the group member kicked from the group successfully |
| **ccGroupMemberScopeChanged** | Triggers when the group member scope is changed in the group      |

**Example**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart your_screen.dart
import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';
import 'package:cometchat_sdk/models/action.dart' as cc;
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class YourScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const YourScreen({super.key});

  @override
  State<YourScreen> createState() => _YourScreenState();
}

class _YourScreenState extends State<YourScreen> with CometChatGroupEventListener {

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    CometChatGroupEvents.addGroupsListener("listenerId", this); // Add the listener
  }

  @override
  void dispose(){
    super.dispose();
    CometChatGroupEvents.removeGroupsListener("listenerId"); // Remove the listener
  }

  @override
  void ccGroupMemberScopeChanged(cc.Action message, User updatedUser, String scopeChangedTo, String scopeChangedFrom, Group group) {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  }

  @override
  void ccGroupMemberBanned(cc.Action message, User bannedUser, User bannedBy, Group bannedFrom) {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  }

  @override
  void ccGroupMemberKicked(cc.Action message, User kickedUser, User kickedBy, Group kickedFrom) {
    // TODO("Not yet implemented")
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }

}
```

### Advanced

For advanced-level customization, you can set custom widgets to the widget. This lets you tailor each aspect of the widget to fit your exact needs and application aesthetics. You can create and define your own widgets and then incorporate those into the widget.

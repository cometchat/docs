Elements is a set of pre-built UI components that act as building blocks of our UI Kit. These UI components are built following the [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) standard and using [lit](https://lit.dev/) library. This allows us to create a framework-agnostic solution so that they can be integrated with our web UIKits such as React, Angular and Vue.

### Example

Below is an example that showcases the creation and manipulation of an instance of `CardMessage`:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
// Create an instance of APIAction

let apiAction = new APIAction("https://example.com/api", "POST");

// Create instance of ButtonElement for card actions

let cardAction = new ButtonElement("1", apiAction, "Click Me");

// Create a new instance of CardMessage

let cardMessage = new CardMessage(
  "receiverId",
  CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER,
  "customType",
  "This is a card",
  [cardAction]
);

cardMessage.setImageUrl("https://example.com/image.png");
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

In this example, a new instance of CardMessage is created. The text, card actions and image URL are retrieved, updated, and retrieved again. Then a new CardMessage instance is made from a JSON object, and the text is retrieved and logged.

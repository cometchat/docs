## Create a Group

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I create a public, private or password-protected group?*

You can create a group using `createGroup()` method. This method takes a `Group` object as input.

To create an object of `Group` class, you can use either of the below two constructors:

1. `new Group(String GUID, String name, String groupType, String password)`
2. `new Group(String GUID, String name, String groupType, String password, String icon, String description)`

The `groupType` needs to be either of the below 3 values:

1.`CometChatConstants.GROUP_TYPE_PUBLIC` (public)

2.`CometChatConstants.GROUP_TYPE_PASSWORD` (password)

3.`CometChatConstants.GROUP_TYPE_PRIVATE` (private)

```js
var GUID = "GUID";
var groupName = "Hello Group!";
var groupType = CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PUBLIC;
var password = "";

var group = new CometChat.Group(GUID, groupName, groupType, password);

CometChat.createGroup(group).then(
	group => {
		console.log("Group created successfully:", group);
	}, error => {
		console.log("Group creation failed with exception:", error);
	}
);
```

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```ts
var GUID: string = "GUID";
var groupName: string = "Hello Group!";
var groupType: string = CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PUBLIC;
var password: string = "";

var group: CometChat.Group = new CometChat.Group(GUID, groupName, groupType, password);

CometChat.createGroup(group).then(
    (group: CometChat.Group) => {
        console.log("Group created successfully:", group);
    }, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
        console.log("Group creation failed with exception:", error);
    }
);
```

The createGroup() method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `group`   | An instance of `Group` class |

After successful creation of the group, you will receive an instance of `Group` class which contains all the information about the particular group.

<Note>

GUID can be alphanumeric with underscore and hyphen. Spaces, punctuation and other special characters are not allowed.

</Note>

## Add members while creating a group

You can create a group and add members at the same time using the `createGroupWithMembers()` method. This method takes the `Group` Object, Array of `Group Member` Object to be added & Array of `UIDs` to be banned.

To create an object of `Group` class, you can use either of the below two constructors:

1. `new Group(String GUID, String name, String groupType, String password)`
2. `new Group(String GUID, String name, String groupType, String password, String icon, String description)`

The `groupType` needs to be either of the below 3 values:

1. `CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PUBLIC`
2. `CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PASSWORD`
3. `CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PRIVATE`

To create an object of `Group Member` class, you can use the below constructor:

* new CometChat.GroupMember(String UID, String scope)

<Tab title="JavaScript">
```js
let GUID = "cometchat-guid-11";
let UID = "cometchat-uid-1";
let groupName = "Hello Group!";
let groupType = CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PUBLIC;

let group = new CometChat.Group(GUID, groupName, groupType);
let members = [
  new CometChat.GroupMember(UID, CometChat.GROUP_MEMBER_SCOPE.PARTICIPANT)
];
let banMembers = ["cometchat-uid-2"];

CometChat.createGroupWithMembers(group, members, banMembers).then(
	response => {
		console.log("Group created successfully", response);
	}, error => {
		console.log("Some error occured while creating group", error)
	}
);
```

let groupName: string = "Hello Group!";
let groupType: string = CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PUBLIC;

let group: CometChat.Group = new CometChat.Group(GUID, groupName, groupType);
let members: Array<CometChat.GroupMember> = [
  new CometChat.GroupMember(UID, CometChat.GROUP_MEMBER_SCOPE.PARTICIPANT)
];
let banMembers: Array<String> = ["cometchat-uid-2"];

CometChat.createGroupWithMembers(group, members, banMembers).then(
	(response: Object) => {
		console.log("Group created successfully", response);
	}, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
		console.log("Some error occured while creating group", error)
	}
);
```

This method returns an Object which has two keys: `group` & `members` . The group key has the Group Object which contains all the information of the group which is created. The members key has the `UID` of the users and the value will either be `success` or an `error` message describing why the operation to add/ban the user failed.

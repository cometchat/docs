Calling is a core feature of CometChat.

## Prerequisites

1. CometChat Core SDK installed.
2. Performed the steps mentioned in the [Setup](/sdk/android/setup) guide

<Note>

v2.4+ onwards, Voice & Video Calling functionality has been moved to a separate library. Please add the following dependency to your app-level `build.gradle` file in case you plan on using the Voice and Video Calling feature.

`dependencies { implementation 'com.cometchat:calls-sdk-android:4.1.0 }`

</Note>

CometChat allows two mechanisms for calling

1. **Direct Calling**
2. **Default Calling**

## Direct Calling

Direct Calling allows you to start the call/conference sessions directly with the session Id of your choice. All the users joining the same session Id are connected to the same call/conference. For more information on Direct Calling, please visit the [Direct Calling docs](/sdk/android/direct-calling).

## Default Calling

The second approach that CometChat allows is to implement the entire calling flow where one user initiates a call/conference and other user/users who want to be a part of the call accept/reject the call. All the users that accept the call are connected to the same session. For more information on Default Calling, please visit the [Default Calling docs.](/sdk/android/default-calling)

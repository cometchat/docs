*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I create a public, private or password-protected group?*

You can create a group using `createGroup()` method. This method takes a `Group` object as input.

The `groupType` needs to be either of the below 3 values:

1.`CometChatGroupType.`*public* (public)

2.`CometChatGroupType.`*password* (password)

3.`CometChatGroupType.`*private* (private)

```dart
String GUID = "GUID";
     String groupName = "Hello Group!";
     String groupType = CometChatGroupType.public;
     String password = "";

await CometChat.createGroup(GUID , groupName, groupType ,password: password,
   onSuccess: (Group group){
     debugPrint("Group Created Successfully : $group ");
   },onError: (CometChatException e) {
     debugPrint("Group Creation failed with exception: ${e.message}");
   });
```

The `createGroup()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                  |
| :--------- | :---------------------------- |
| `group`   | An instance of `Group` class |

After the successful creation of the group, you will receive an instance of `Group` class which contains all the information about the particular group.

<Warning>

GUID can be alphanumeric with underscore and hyphen. Spaces, punctuation and other special characters are not allowed.

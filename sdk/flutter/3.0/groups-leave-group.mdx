title: "Leave A Group"
---



In order to stop receiving updates and messages for any particular joined group, you will have to leave the group using the `leaveGroup()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String GUID = "GUID";

CometChat.leaveGroup(GUID, onSuccess: ( String message) {
        debugPrint("Group Left  Successfully : $message");
      },onError: (CometChatException e) {
        debugPrint("Group Left failed  : ${e.message}");
      });
```

</Tab>

| Parameter | Description                                   |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group you would like to leave |

Once a group is left, the user will no longer receive any updates or messages pertaining to the group.

## Real-time Group Member Left Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know if someone has left it when my app is running?*

If a user leaves a group, the members of the group receive a real-time event in the `onGroupMemberLeft()` method of the `GroupListener` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with GroupListener {

  //CometChat.addGroupListener("group_Listener_id", this);
  @override
  void onGroupMemberLeft(Action action, User leftUser, Group leftGroup) {
    print("onGroupMemberLeft ");

  }
}
```

## Missed Group Member Left Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know if someone has left it when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has left any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For the group member left event, in the `Action` object received, the following fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - `left`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who left the group
3. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the group the user has left

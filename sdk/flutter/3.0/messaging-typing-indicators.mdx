## Send a Typing Indicator

*In other words, as a sender, how do I let the recipient(s) know that I'm typing?*

### Start Typing

You can use the `startTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged in user has started typing. The receiver will receive this information in the `onTypingStarted()` method of the `MessageListener` class. In order to send the typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart (Start Typing User)">
```
CometChat.startTyping(
            receaverUid: "UID",
            receiverType: CometChatReceiverType.user,
        );
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Dart (Start Typing Group)">
```
CometChat.startTyping(
            receaverUid: "GUID",
            receiverType: CometChatReceiverType.group,
        );
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Stop Typing

You can use the `endTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged in user has stopped typing. The receiver will receive this information in the `onTypingEnded()` method of the `MessageListener` class. In order to send the typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart (End Typing User)">
```
CometChat.endTyping(
            receaverUid: "UID",
            receiverType: CometChatReceiverType.user);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Dart (End Typing Group)">
```
CometChat.endTyping(
            receaverUid: "GUID",
            receiverType: CometChatReceiverType.group);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

You can use the `metadata` field of the `TypingIndicator` class to pass additional data along with the typing indicators. The metadata field is a Map and can be set using the `.metadata` parameter of the `TypingIndicator` class. This data will be received at the receiver end and can be obtained using the same parameter.

</Note>

## Real-time Typing Indicators

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when someone is typing?*

You will receive the typing indicators in the `onTypingStarted()` and the `onTypingEnded()` method of the registered `MessageListener` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with MessageListener {

  //CometChat.addMessageListener("listenerId", this);
  @override
  void onTypingStarted(TypingIndicator typingIndicator) {
    // TODO: implement onTypingStarted
  }

  @override
  void onTypingEnded(TypingIndicator typingIndicator) {
    // TODO: implement onTypingEnded
  }

  
}
```

The `TypingIndicator` class consists of the below parameters:

| Parameter      | Information                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sender`       | An object of the `User` class holding all the information related to the sender of the typing indicator.                                                                                             |
| `receiverId`   | `UID` of the receiver. This is the ID of the group or the user the typing indicator is being sent to.                                                                                                |
| `receiverType` | This parameter indicates if the typing indicator is to be sent to a user or a group. The possible values are: 1. `CometChatConstants.RECEIVER_TYPE_USER` 2. `CometChatConstants.RECEIVER_TYPE_GROUP` |
| `metadata`     | A JSONObject to provider additional data                                                                                                                                                             |

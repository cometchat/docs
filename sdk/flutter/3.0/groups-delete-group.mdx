## Delete Group

To delete a group you need to use the `deleteGroup()` method. The user must be an **Admin** of the group they are trying to delete.

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String GUID = "GUID";

CometChat.deleteGroup(GUID, onSuccess: (String message) {
  debugPrint("Deleted Group Successfully : $message ");
}, onError: (CometChatException e) {
  debugPrint("Delete Group failed with exception: ${e.message}");
});
```

</Tab>

The `deleteGroup()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                    |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group you would like to delete |

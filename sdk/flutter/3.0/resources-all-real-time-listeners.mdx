CometChat provides 4 listeners viz.

1. [UserListener](/sdk/flutter/3.0/resources-all-real-time-listeners#user-listener)
2. [GroupListener](/sdk/flutter/3.0/resources-all-real-time-listeners#group-listener)
3. [MessageListener](/sdk/flutter/3.0/resources-all-real-time-listeners#message-listener)

## User Listener

The `UserListener` class provides you with live events related to users. Below are the callback methods provided by the `UserListener` class.

| Method                     | Information                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onUserOnline(User user)`  | This method is triggered when a user comes online and is available to chat. The details of the user can be obtained from the user object received as the method parameter. |
| `onUserOffline(User user)` | This method is triggered when a user goes offline. The details of the user can be obtained from the User object received as the parameter.                                 |

To add the `UserListener`, you need to use the `addUserListener()` method provided by the `CometChat` class.

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with UserListener {

  //CometChat.addUserListener("user_Listener_id", this);
	  @override
  void onUserOnline(User user) {
    // TODO: implement onUserOnline
  }
  @override
  void onUserOffline(User user) {
    // TODO: implement onUserOffline
  }
  
  
}
```

where `UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID` is the unique identifier for the listener. Please make sure that no two listeners are added with the same listener id as this could lead to unexpected behaviour resulting in loss of events.

Once the activity/fragment where the `UserListener` is declared is not in use, you need to remove the listener using the `removeUserListener()` method which takes the id of the listener to be removed as the parameter. We suggest you call this method in the `onPause()` method of the activity/fragment.

CometChat.removeUserListener(UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID)
```

## Group Listener

The `GroupListener` class provides you with all the real-time events related to groups. Below are the callback methods provided by the `GroupListener` class.

To add the `GroupListener`, you need to use the `addGroupListener()` method provided by the `CometChat` class.

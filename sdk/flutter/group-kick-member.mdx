---



There are certain actions that can be performed on the group members:

1. Kick a member from the group
2. Ban a member from the group
3. Unban a member from the group
4. Update the scope of the member of the group

All of the above actions can only be performed by the **Admin** or the **Moderator** of the group.

## Kick a Group Member

The Admin or Moderator of a group can kick a member out of the group using the `kickGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String uid= "cometchat-uid-3";
String guid = "GUID";
CometChat.kickGroupMember(guid: guid,uid: uid,
  onSuccess: (String message) {
    debugPrint("Group Member Kicked  Successfully : $message");
  }, onError: (CometChatException e) {
    debugPrint("Group Member Kicked failed  : ${e.message}");
  });
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `kickGroupMember()` takes following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                           |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `UID`     | The UID of the user to be kicked                      |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group from which user is to be kicked |

The kicked user will be no longer part of the group and can not perform any actions in the group, but the kicked user can rejoin the group.

## Ban a Group Member

The Admin or Moderator of the group can ban a member from the group using the `banGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String uid= "cometchat-uid-3";
String guid = "GUID";
CometChat.banGroupMember(guid: guid,uid: uid,
                       onSuccess: (String message) {
                         debugPrint("Group Member Banned  Successfully : $message");
                       },onError: (CometChatException e) {
                         debugPrint("Group Member Ban failed  : ${e.message}");
                       });
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `banGroupMember()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                             |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UID`     | The `UID` of the user to be banned                      |
| `GUID`    | The `GUID` of the group from which user is to be banned |

The banned user will be no longer part of the group and can not perform any actions in the group. A banned user cannot rejoin the group same group without being unbanned.

## Unban a Banned Group Member from a Group

Only Admin or Moderators of the group can unban a previously banned member from the group using the `unbanGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String uid= "cometchat-uid-3";
String guid = "GUID";
CometChat.unbanGroupMember(guid: guid,uid: uid,
                         onSuccess: (String message) {
                           debugPrint("Group Member Unbanned  Successfully : $message");
                         },
                         onError: (CometChatException e) {
                           debugPrint("Group Member Unban failed  : ${e.message}");
                         });
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `unbanGroupMember()` method takes the following parameters

| Parameter | Description                                          |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `UID`     | The UID of the user to be unbanned                   |
| `GUID`    | The UID of the group from which user is to be banned |

The unbanned user can now rejoin the group.

## Get List of Banned Members for a Group

In order to fetch the list of banned groups members for a group, you can use the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class. To use this class i.e to create an object of the BannedGroupMembersRequest class, you need to use the `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class. The `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the parameters based on which the banned group members are to be fetched.

The `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the below parameters:

The `GUID` of the group for which the banned members are to be fetched must be specified in the constructor of the `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class.

### Set Limit

This method sets the limit i.e. the number of banned members that should be fetched in a single iteration.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder builder = BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder(guid: conversationWith);
BannedGroupMembersRequest  bannedGroupMembersRequest = (builder
     ..limit = 50
     ).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Set Search Keyword

This method allows you to set the search string based on which the banned group members are to be fetched.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder builder = BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder(guid: conversationWith);
BannedGroupMembersRequest  bannedGroupMembersRequest = (builder
     ..limit = 50
     ..searchKeyword = "abc"
     ).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Finally, once all the parameters are set to the builder class, you need to call the `build()` method to get the object of the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class.

Once you have the object of the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class, you need to call the `fetchNext()` method. Calling this method will return a list of `GroupMember` objects containing n number of banned members where n is the limit set in the builder class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder builder = BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder(guid: conversationWith);
BannedGroupMembersRequest  bannedGroupMembersRequest = (builder
     ..limit = 50
     ).build();

bannedGroupMembersRequest.fetchNext( onSuccess: (List<GroupMember> groupMembers) {
        debugPrint("Banned Group Members Fetched Successfully : $groupMembers");
      },onError: (CometChatException e) {
        debugPrint("Banned Group Members Fetch failed with exception: ${e.message}");
      });
```

</Tab>

## Real-Time Group Member Kicked/Banned Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is banned/kicked when my app is running?*

In order to get real-time events for the kick/ban/unban group members you need to override the following methods of the `GroupListener` class.

1. `onGroupMemberKicked()` - Triggered when any group member has been kicked.
2. `onGroupMemberBanned()` - Triggered when any group member has been banned.
3. `onGroupMemberUnbanned()` - Triggered when any group member has been unbanned.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with GroupListener {

//CometChat.addGroupListener("group_Listener_id", this);

@override
void onGroupMemberKicked(Action action, User kickedUser, User kickedBy, Group kickedFrom) {
  print("onGroupMemberKicked ");
}
void onGroupMemberBanned(Action action, User bannedUser, User bannedBy, Group bannedFrom) {

  print("onGroupMemberBanned ");
}

@override
void onGroupMemberUnbanned(Action action, User unbannedUser, User unbannedBy, Group unbannedFrom) {
  print("onGroupMemberUnbanned ");
}
}
```

## Missed Group Member Kicked/Banned Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is banned/kicked when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has been kicked/banned/unbanned from any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For group member kicked event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `kicked`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has kicked the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been kicked
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was kicked

For group member banned event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `banned`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has banned the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been banned
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was banned

For group member unbanned event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `unbanned`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has unbanned the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been unbanned
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was unbanned

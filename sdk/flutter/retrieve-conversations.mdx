## Retrieve List of Conversations

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I retrieve the latest conversations that I've been a part of?*

To fetch the list of conversations, you can use the `ConversationsRequest` class. To use this class i.e. to create an object of the `ConversationsRequest` class, you need to use the `ConversationsRequestBuilder` class. The `ConversationsRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the parameters based on which the conversations are to be fetched.

The `ConversationsRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the below parameters:

### Set Limit

This method sets the limit i.e. the number of conversations that should be fetched in a single iteration.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
  ..limit = 50
).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Set Conversation Type

This method can be used to fetch user or group conversations specifically. The `conversationType` variable can hold one of the below two values:

* user - Only fetches user conversation.
* group - Only fetches group conversations.

If none is set, the list of conversations will include both user and group conversations.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
  ..limit = 50
  ..conversationType = CometChatConversationType.user
).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### With User and Group Tags

This method can be used to fetch the user/group tags in the `Conversation` Object. By default the value is false.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
  ..limit = 50
  ..withUserAndGroupTags  = true
).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### With Tags

This method makes sure that the tags associated with the conversations are returned along with the other details of the conversations. The default value for this parameter is `false`

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
  ..limit = 50
  ..withTags = true
).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Set Tags

This method helps you fetch the conversations based on the specified tags.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
List<String> tags = [];
tags.add("archived");
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
  ..limit = 50
  ..tags = tags
).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Include Blocked Users

This method helps you fetch the conversations of users whom the logged-in user has blocked.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
  ..limit = 50
  ..includeBlockedUsers = true
).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### With Blocked Info

This method can be used to fetch the blocked information of the blocked user in the `ConversationWith` object.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
  ..limit = 50
  ..withBlockedInfo = true
).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Search Conversations

This method helps you search a conversation based on User or Group name.

<Note>

This feature is only available with `Conversation & Advanced Search`. The `Conversation & Advanced Search` is only available in `Advanced` & `Custom` [plans](https://www.cometchat.com/pricing). If you're already on one of these plans, please enable the `Conversation & Advanced Search` from [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com) (Open your app, navigate to Chats -> Settings -> General Configuration)

</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
  ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
    ..limit = 50
    ..searchKeyword = "Hiking"
  ).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Unread Conversations

This method helps you fetch unread conversations.

<Note>

This feature is only available with `Conversation & Advanced Search`. The `Conversation & Advanced Search` is only available in `Advanced` & `Custom` [plans](https://www.cometchat.com/pricing). If you're already on one of these plans, please enable the `Conversation & Advanced Search` from [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com) (Open your app, navigate to Chats -> Settings -> General Configuration)

</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
  ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
    ..limit = 50
    ..unread = true
  ).build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Finally, once all the parameters are set to the builder class, you need to call the `build()` method to get the object of the `ConversationsRequest` class.

Once you have the object of the `ConversationsRequest` class, you need to call the `fetchNext()` method. Calling this method will return a list of `Conversation` objects containing X number of conversations depending on the limit set.

A Maximum of only 50 Conversations can be fetched at once.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
ConversationsRequest conversationRequest = (ConversationsRequestBuilder()
    ..limit = 50
  ).build();

conversationRequest.fetchNext(
      onSuccess: (List<Conversation> conversations){


      }, onError: (CometChatException e){

      }
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `Conversation`object consists of the below fields:

| Field                 | Information                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conversationId`      | ID of the conversation                                               |
| `conversationType`    | Type of conversation (user/group)                                    |
| `lastMessage`         | Last message the conversation                                        |
| `conversationWith`    | `User` or `Group` object containing the details of the user or group |
| `unreadMessageCount`  | Unread message count for the conversation                            |
| `unreadMentionsCount` | the count of unread mentions in the conversation.                    |
| `lastReadMessageId`   | the ID of the last read message in the conversation.                 |

## Tag Conversation

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I tag a conversation?*

In order to tag a specific conversation, you can use the `tagConversation()` method. The `tagConversation()` method accepts three parameters.

1. `conversationWith`: UID/GUID of the user/group whose conversation you want to fetch.

2. `conversationType`: The `conversationType` variable can hold one of the below two values:

   1. user - Only fetches user conversation.
   2. group - Only fetches group conversations.

3. `tags`: The `tags` variable will be a list of tags you want to add to a conversation.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String conversationWith = "cometchat-uid-1"; //id of the user/group
String conversationType = "user";
List<String> tags = [];
tags.add("archived");

CometChat.tagConversation(conversationWith, conversationType, tags,
	onSuccess: (Conversation conversation) {
		debugPrint("Conversation tagged Successfully : $conversation");
	}, onError: (CometChatException e) {
		debugPrint("Conversation tagging failed  : ${e.message}");
	}
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

The tags for conversations are one-way. This means that if user A tags a conversation with user B, that tag will be applied to that conversation only for user A.

</Note>

## Retrieve Single Conversation

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I retrieve a specific conversation?*

In order to fetch a specific conversation, you can use the `getConversation` method. The `getConversation` method accepts two parameters.

1. `conversationWith`: UID/GUID of the user/group whose conversation you want to fetch.
2. `conversationType`: The `conversationType` variable can hold one of the below two values:

* user - Only fetches user conversation.
* group - Only fetches group conversations.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String conversationWith = "cometchat-uid-1"; //id of the user/group
String conversationType = "user";
CometChat.getConversation(conversationWith, conversationType,
	onSuccess: (Conversation conversation) {
		debugPrint("Fetch Conversation Successfully : $conversation");
	}, onError: (CometChatException e) {
		debugPrint("Fetch Conversation  failed  : ${e.message}");
	}
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Convert Messages to Conversations

As per our [Receive Messages](/sdk/flutter/receive-messages) guide, for real-time messages, you will always receive `Message` objects and not `Conversation` objects. Thus, you will need a mechanism to convert the `Message` object to a `Conversation` object. You can use the `getConversationFromMessage` method for this purpose.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
Conversation conversation = CometChat.getConversationFromMessage(message);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Info>

While converting `Message` object to `Conversation` object, the `unreadMessageCount` & `tags` will not be available in the `Conversation` object. The unread message count needs to be managed in your client-side code.

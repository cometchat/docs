## Mark Messages as Delivered

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I inform the sender that I've received a message?*

You can mark the messages for a particular conversation as read using the `markAsDelivered()` method. This method takes the below parameters as input:

| Parameter    | Information                                                                                                |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | The ID of the message above which all the messages for a particular conversation are to be marked as read. |
| receiverUid  | In case of one to one conversation message's sender UID will be the receipt's receiver Id.                 |
| receiverType | Type of the receiver. Could be either of the two values( user or group).                                   |

Messages for both user & group conversations can be marked as read using this method.

Ideally, you would like to mark all the messages as delivered for any conversation when the user opens the chat window for that conversation. This includes two scenarios:

1. **When the list of messages for the conversation is fetched**: In this case you need to obtain the last message in the list of messages and pass the message ID of that message to the markAsDelivered() method.
2. **When the user is on the chat window and a real-time message is received:** In this case you need to obtain the message ID of the message and pass it to the markAsDelivered() method.

This method will mark all the messages before the messageId specified, for the conversation with receiverId and receiverType(user/group) as read.

In case you would like to be notified of an error if the receipts fail to go through you can use `markAsDelivered()` method with the callbacks as shown below:

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
CometChat.markAsDelivered(message, onSuccess: (String unused) {
debugPrint("markAsDelivered : $unused ");
}, onError: (CometChatException e) {
debugPrint("markAsDelivered unsuccessful : ${e.message} ");
});
```

## Mark Messages as Read

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I inform the sender I've read a message?*

You can mark the messages for a particular conversation as read using the `markAsRead()` method. This method takes the below parameters as input:

Messages for both user and group conversations can be marked as read using this method.

The message object takes the below parameters as input:

| Parameter    | Information                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | The ID of the message above which all the messages for a particular conversation are to be marked as read.                                                                      |
| receiverUid  | In a one-to-one conversation, the message's sender UID will be the receipt's receiver ID. In a group conversation, the message's receiver ID will be the receipt's receiver ID. |
| receiverType | Type of the receiver. Could be either of the two values (user or group).                                                                                                        |

Messages for both user and group conversations can be marked as read using this method.

Ideally, you should mark all the messages as read for any conversation when the user opens the chat window for that conversation. This includes two scenarios:

1. **When the list of messages for the conversation is fetched**: In this case you need to obtain the last message in the list of messages and pass the message to the `markAsRead()` method.
2. **When the user is on the chat window and a real-time message is received:** In this case you need to obtain the message and pass it to the `markAsRead()` method

This method will mark all the messages before the message specified, for the conversation with `receiverId` and `receiverType` (user/group) as read.

Another option the CometChat SDK provides is to pass the entire message object to the markAsRead() method. If the message object is the last message, the entire conversation will be marked as read.

## Mark Messages as Unread

The Mark as Unread feature allows users to designate specific messages or conversations as unread, even if they have been previously viewed.

This feature is valuable for users who want to revisit and respond to important messages or conversations later, ensuring they don't forget or overlook them.

*In other words, how I can mark message as unread?*

You can mark the messages for a particular conversation as unread using the `markAsUnread()` method.

| Parameter | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| message   | To mark a message as unread, pass a non-null `BaseMessage` instance to the `markAsUnread()` function. All messages below that message in the conversation will contribute to the unread messages count. Example : When User B sends User A a total of 10 messages, and User A invokes the `markAsUnread()` method on the fifth message, all messages located below the fifth message within the conversation list will be designated as unread. This results in a notification indicating there are 5 unread messages in the conversation list. |

## Receive Delivery & Read Receipts

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when a message I sent has been delivered or read by someone?*

### Real-time events

1. `onMessagesDelivered()` - This event is triggered when a message is delivered to a user.
2. `onMessagesRead()` - This event is triggered when a message is read by a user.
3. `onMessagesDeliveredToAll()` - This event is triggered when a group message is delivered to all members of the group. This event is only for Group conversations.
4. `onMessagesReadByAll()` - This event is triggered when a group message is read by all members of the group. This event is only for Group conversations.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with MessageListener {

//CometChat.addMessageListener("listenerId", this);
@override
void onMessagesDelivered(MessageReceipt messageReceipt) {
  // TODO: implement onMessagesDelivered
}

@override
void onMessagesRead(MessageReceipt messageReceipt) {
 // TODO: implement onMessagesRead
}

@override
void onMessagesDeliveredToAll(MessageReceipt messageReceipt) {
  // TODO: implement onMessagesDeliveredToAll
}

@override
void onMessagesReadByAll(MessageReceipt messageReceipt) {
 // TODO: implement onMessagesReadByAll
}

}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

You will receive events in the form of `MessageReceipt` objects. The message receipt contains the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Information                                                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messageId`    | The ID of the message prior to which all the messages for that particular conversation have been marked as read.     |
| `sender`       | User object containing the details of the user who has marked the message as read.                                   |
| `receiverId`   | Id of the receiver whose conversation has been marked as read.                                                       |
| `receiverType` | Type of the receiver (user/group)                                                                                    |
| `receiptType`  | Type of the receipt (read/delivered)                                                                                 |
| `deliveredAt`  | The timestamp of the time when the message was delivered. This will only be present if the receiptType is delivered. |
| `readAt`       | The timestamp of the time when the message was read. This will only be present when the receiptType is read.         |

### Missed Receipts

You will receive message receipts when you load offline messages. While fetching messages in bulk, the message object will have two fields i.e. `deliveredAt` and `readAt` which hold the timestamp for the time the message was delivered and read respectively. Using these two variables, the delivery and read status for a message can be obtained.

However, for a group message, if you wish to fetch the `deliveredAt` and `readAt` fields of individual member of the group you can use the below-described method.

### Receipt History for a Single Message

In order to fetch the message receipts, you can use the `getMessageReceipts()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
private int messageId = 10101;

CometChat.getMessageReceipts(messageId, new CometChat.CallbackListener<List<MessageReceipt>>() {
@Override
  public void onSuccess(List<MessageReceipt> messageReceipts) {
  	// Handle message receipts
}

@Override
  public void onError(CometChatException e) {
  // Handle error
}
});
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

You will receive a list of `MessageReceipt` objects in the `onSuccess()` method.

<Info>

The following features will be available only if the **Enhanced Messaging Status** feature is enabled for your app.

* `onMessagesDeliveredToAll` event,
* `onMessagesReadByAll` event,
* `deliveredAt` field in a group message,
* `readAt` field in a group message.
* `markAsUnread` method.

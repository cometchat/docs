## Join a Group

In order to start participating in group conversations, you will have to join a group. You can do so using the `joinGroup()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String GUID = "GUID";
String groupType = CometChatGroupType.public;
String password = "";

CometChat.joinGroup(GUID, groupType, password: password,
                  onSuccess: (Group group) {
                    debugPrint("Group Joined Successfully : $group ");
                  }, onError: (CometChatException e) {
                    debugPrint("Group Joining failed with exception: ${e.message}");
  });
```

</Tab>

The `joinGroup()` method takes the below parameters

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GUID`      | The GUID of the group you would like to join                                                                                                                                             |
| `groupType` | Type of the group. CometChat provides 3 types of groups viz. 1.CometChatGroupType.*public* (public). 2.CometChatGroupType.*password* (password) 3.CometChatGroupType.*private* (private) |
| `password`  | Password is mandatory in case of a password protected group.                                                                                                                             |

Once you have joined a group successfully, you can send and receive messages in that group.

CometChat keeps a track of the groups joined and you do not need to join the group everytime you want to communicate in the group.

You can identify if a group is joined using the `hasJoined` parameter in the `Group` object.

## Real-time Group Member Joined Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know if someone joins the group when my app is running?*

If a user joins any group, the members of the group receive a real-time event in the `onGroupMemberJoined()` method of the `GroupListener` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with GroupListener {

//CometChat.addGroupListener("group_Listener_id", this);
@override
void onGroupMemberJoined(Action action, User joinedUser, Group joinedGroup) {
  debugPrint("onGroupMemberJoined");
}
```

</Tab>

## Missed Group Member Joined Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know if someone joins the group when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has joined any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For the group member joined event, in the `Action` object received, the following fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - `joined`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who joined the group
3. `actionFor`- Group object containing the details of the group the user has joined

## Change Scope of a Group Member

In order to change the scope of a group member, you can use the `changeGroupMemberScope()`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String UID = "UID";
String GUID = "GUID";
String scope = CometChatMemberScope.admin;

CometChat.updateGroupMemberScope(guid: GUID, uid: UID,scope: scope,
        onSuccess: (String message) {
          debugPrint("Group Member Scope Changed  Successfully : $message");
        },
        onError: (CometChatException e) {
          debugPrint("Group Member Scope Change failed  : ${e.message}");
        });
```

</Tab>

This method takes the below parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UID`     | The UID of the member whose scope you would like to change                                                                                                                                                          |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group for which the member's scope needs to be changed                                                                                                                                              |
| `scope`   | the updated scope of the member. This can be either of the 3 values: 1.`CometChatMemberScope.`*admin* (admin) 2.`CometChatMemberScope.`*moderator* (moderator) 3.`CometChatMemberScope.`*participant* (participant) |

The default scope of any member is `participant`. Only the **Admin** of the group can change the scope of any participant in the group.

## Real-Time Group Member Scope Changed Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone's scope is changed when my app is running?*

In order to receive real-time events whenever a group member's scope changes, you will need to override the `onGroupMemberScopeChanged()` method of the `GroupListener` class

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with GroupListener {

//CometChat.addGroupListener("group_Listener_id", this);
@override
void onGroupMemberScopeChanged(Action action, User updatedBy, User updatedUser, String scopeChangedTo, String scopeChangedFrom, Group group) {
  print("onGroupMemberScopeChanged ");

}
}
```

</Tab>

## Missed Group Member Scope Changed Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone's scope is changed when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member's scope has been changed for any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For the group member scope changed event, in the `Action` object received, the following fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - `scopeChanged`
2. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the user whos scope has been changed
3. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who changed the scope of the member
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the group in which the member scope was changed
5. `oldScope` - The original scope of the member
6. `newScope` - The updated scope of the member

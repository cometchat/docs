## Overview

CometChat's Flutter Call SDK provides a comprehensive way to integrate call logs into your application, enhancing your user experience by allowing users to effortlessly keep track of their communication history. Call logs provide crucial information such as call duration, participants, and more.

This feature not only allows users to review their past interactions but it also serves as an effective tool to revisit important conversation details. With the flexibility of fetching call logs, filtering them according to specific parameters, and obtaining detailed information of individual calls, application developers can use this feature to build a more robust and interactive communication framework.

In the following sections, we will guide you through the process of working with call logs, offering a deeper insight into how to optimally use this feature in your Flutter application.

## Fetching Call Logs

To fetch all call logs in your Flutter application, you should use the `CallLogRequestBuilder`, This builder allows you to customize the call logs fetching process according to your needs.

```dart
CallLogRequest callAppSettings = (CallLogRequestBuilder()
    ..authToken = AppConfig.userAuthToken
    ..limit = 30
    ..callCategory = CometChatCallsConstants.callCategoryCall
).build();
```

`CallLogRequestBuilder` has the following settings available.

| Setting                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `int limit`            | Specifies the number of call logs to fetch.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `String callType`      | Sets the type of calls to fetch (audio or video). It accepts following String's as a parameter `"video"`, `"audio"` & `"audio/video"`                                                                               |
| `String callStatus`    | Sets the status of calls to fetch (initiated, ongoing, etc.). It accepts following String's as a parameter `"ongoing"`, `"busy"`, `"rejected"`, `"cancelled"`, `"ended"`, `"missed"`, `"initiated"`, `"unanswered"` |
| `bool hasRecording`    | Sets whether to fetch calls that have recordings.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `String callCategory`  | Sets the category of calls to fetch (call or meet). It accepts following String's as a parameter `"call"` & `"meet"`                                                                                                |
| `String callDirection` | Sets the direction of calls to fetch. It accepts following String's as a parameter `"incoming"` & `"outgoing"`                                                                                                      |
| `String uid`           | Sets the UID of the user whose call logs to fetch.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `String guid`          | Sets the GUID of the user whose call logs to fetch.                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Fetch Next

The**`fetchNext()`**method retrieves the next set of call logs.

```dart
CallLogRequest callAppSettings = (CallLogRequestBuilder()
    ..authToken = CometChat.getUserAuthToken()
    ..limit = 30
    ..callCategory = CometChatCallsConstants.callCategoryCall
).build();

callAppSettings.fetchNext(onSuccess: (List<CallLog> callLogs){
  debugPrint("Success");
}, onError: (CometChatCallsException e) {
  debugPrint("Error");
});
```

### Fetch Previous

The**`fetchPrevious()`**method retrieves the previous set of call logs.

```dart
CallLogRequest callAppSettings = (CallLogRequestBuilder()
    ..authToken = CometChat.getUserAuthToken()
    ..limit = 30
    ..callCategory = CometChatCallsConstants.callCategoryCall
).build();

callAppSettings.fetchPrevious(onSuccess: (List<CallLog> callLogs){
  debugPrint("Success");
}, onError: (CometChatCallsException e) {
  debugPrint("Error");
});
```

## Get Call Details

To retrieve the specific details of a call, use the**`getCallDetails()`**method. This method requires the Auth token of the logged-in user and the session ID along with a callback listener. Upon success, this function will return a list of call details, as multiple calls can be initiated for one session ID.

```dart
String sessionID = "SESSION_ID";
String userAuthToken = CometChat.getUserAuthToken();

CometChatCalls.getCallDetails(sessionID, userAuthToken, onSuccess: (List<CallLog> callLogs) {
  debugPrint("Success");
}, onError: (CometChatCallsException e) {
  debugPrint("Error");
});
```

Note: Replace**`"SESSION_ID"`**with the ID of the session you are interested in.

Mentions are a powerful tool for enhancing communication in messaging platforms. They streamline interaction by allowing users to easily engage and collaborate with particular individuals, especially in group conversations.

Mentions in messages enable users to refer to specific individuals within a conversation.

## Send Mentioned Messages

Every User object has a String unique identifier associated with them which can be found in a property called uid. To mention a user in a message, the message text should contain the uid in following format: `<@uid:UID_OF_THE_USER>`. For example, to mention the user with UID cometchat-uid-1 in a text message, your text should be "`<@uid:cometchat-uid-1>`"

```dart
String receiverID = "UID";
User sender = User(name: "Sender", uid: "senderUID");
String messageText = "Hello, <@uid:cometchat-uid-1>";
String receiverType = CometChatReceiverType.user;

TextMessage textMessage = TextMessage(
      text: messageText,
      sender: sender,
      receiverUid: receiverID,
      receiverType: receiverType,
			category: CometChatMessageCategory.message,
      type: CometChatMessageType.text);

CometChat.sendMessage(textMessage, onSuccess:(TextMessage textMessage) {
      print("Message sent successfully: ${textMessage.text}, mentioned users: ${textMessage.mentionedUsers}");
  },
   onError:(CometChatException e) {
      print("Message sending failed with exception: $e");
  }
);

## Mentioned Messages

By default, the SDK will fetch all the messages irrespective of the fact that the logged-in user is mentioned or not in the message. The SDK has other optional filters such as tag info and blocked info.

| Setting                               | Description                                                                                                                                         | Default Value |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| `mentionsWithTagInfo(bool value)`     | If set to `true`, SDK will fetch a list of messages where users are mentioned & will also fetch the tags of the mentioned users.                    | false         |
| `mentionsWithBlockedInfo(bool value)` | If set to `true`, SDK will fetch a list of messages where users are mentioned & will also fetch their blocked relationship with the logged-in user. | false         |

## Get Users Mentioned In a Particular Message

To retrieve the list of users mentioned in the particular message, you can use the `mentionedUsers` property on any `BaseMessage`. This property will return an array containing User objects of the mentioned users, or an empty array if no users were mentioned in the message.

<Tab title="Syntax">
```dart
message.mentionedUsers
```

</Tabs>

## Check if Logged-in user has been mentioned

To check if the logged-in user has been mentioned in a particular message we can use the `hasMentionedMe` property on any `BaseMessage`. This property will return a boolean value, true if the logged-in user has been mentioned, otherwise `false`.

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
message.hasMentionedMe
```

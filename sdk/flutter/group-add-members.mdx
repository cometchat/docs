## Add Members to Group

You can add members to the group using the `addMembersToGroup()` method. This method takes the below parameters:

1. `GUID` - GUID of the group users are to be added to.
2. `List<GroupMember> members` - This is a list of `GroupMember` objects. In order to add members, you need to create an object of the `GroupMember` class. The `UID` and the scope of the `GroupMember` are mandatory.
3. `List<String> bannedMembers` - This is the list of `UIDs` that need to be banned from the group. This can be set to `null` if there are no members to be banned.

```dart
List<GroupMember> groupMembers = [];
GroupMember firstMember = GroupMember.fromUid(
scope: CometChatMemberScope.participant,
uid: "cometchat-uid-3",name: "name");
GroupMember secondMember = GroupMember.fromUid(scope: CometChatMemberScope.admin,
uid: "cometchat-uid-4",name: "name");

groupMembers = [firstMember, secondMember];

CometChat.addMembersToGroup( guid: conversationWith,
        groupMembers: groupMembers,
        onSuccess: (Map<String?,String?> result) {
          debugPrint("Group Member added Successfully : $result");
        },
        onError: (CometChatException e) {
          debugPrint("Group Member addition failed with exception: ${e.message}");
        });
```

In the `onSuccess()` method , you will receive a Map which will contain the `UID` of the users and the value will either be `success` or an error message describing why the operation to add the user to the group or ban the user failed.

## Real-Time Group Member Added Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is added to the group when my app is running?*

<Note>

When a group member is added by another member, this event is triggered. When a user joins a group on their own, the joined event is triggered.

</Note>

To receive real-time events whenever a new member is added to a group, you need to implement the `onMemberAddedToGroup()` methods of the `GroupListener` class.

* `onMemberAddedToGroup()` - This method is triggered when any user is added to the group so that the logged-in user is informed of the other members added to the group.

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
class Class_Name  with GroupListener {

//CometChat.addGroupListener("group_Listener_id", this);
@override
void onMemberAddedToGroup(Action action, User addedby, User userAdded, Group addedTo) {
  print("onMemberAddedToGroup");
}
}
```

## Member Added to Group event in Message History

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is added to the group when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has been added to any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For the group member added event, in the `Action` object received, the following fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - `added`
2. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the user who was added to the group
3. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who added the member to the group
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the group to which the member was added

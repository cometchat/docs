An InteractiveMessage is a specialised object that encapsulates an interactive unit within a chat message, such as an embedded form that users can fill out directly within the chat interface. This enhances user engagement by making the chat experience more interactive and responsive to user input.

## InteractiveMessage

`InteractiveMessage` is a chat message with embedded interactive content. It can contain various properties:

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                       | Required                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| receiverId             | The UID or GUID of the recipient                                                                                                                                  | Yes                       |
| receiverType           | The type of the receiver to whom the message is to be sent i.e CometChatConstants.RECEIVER\_TYPE\_USER (user) or CometChatConstants.RECEIVER\_TYPE\_GROUP (group) | Yes                       |
| messageType            | The type of the message that needs to be sent                                                                                                                     | Yes                       |
| interactiveData        | A JSONObject holding structured data for the interactive element.                                                                                                 | Yes                       |
| allowSenderInteraction | A boolean determining whether the message sender can interact with the message by default it is set to false.                                                     | Optional (Default: false) |
| interactionGoal        | An InteractionGoal object encapsulating the intended outcome of interacting with the InteractiveMessage by default it is set to none                              | Optional (Default: none)  |

## Interaction

An `Interaction` represents a user action involved with an `InteractiveMessage`. It includes:

* `elementId`: An identifier for a specific interactive element.
* `interactedAt`: A timestamp indicating when the interaction occurred.

## Goal Completion

A key feature of `InteractiveMessage` is checking whether a user's interactions with the message meet the defined `InteractionGoal`

You would be tracking every interaction users perform on an `InteractiveMessage` (captured as `Interaction` objects) and comparing those with the defined `InteractionGoal`. The completion of a goal can vary depending on the goal type:

| Goals                            | Description                                                            | Keys                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Any Interaction**              | The goal is considered completed if there is at least one interaction. | CometChatConstants.INTERACTION\_TYPE\_ANY     |
| **Any of Specific Interactions** | The goal is achieved if any of the specified interactions occurred.    | CometChatConstants.INTERACTION\_TYPE\_ANY\_OF |
| **All of Specific Interactions** | The goal is completed when all specified interactions occur.           | CometChatConstants.INTERACTION\_TYPE\_ALL\_OF |
| **None**                         | The goal is never completed.                                           | CometChatConstants.INTERACTION\_TYPE\_NONE    |

This user interaction tracking mechanism provides a flexible and efficient way to monitor user engagement within an interactive chat session. By defining clear interaction goals and checking user interactions against these goals, you can manage user engagement and improve the overall chat experience in your CometChat-enabled application.

## InteractionGoal

The `InteractionGoal` represents the desired outcome of an interaction with an `InteractiveMessage`. It includes:

* `elementIds`: A list of identifiers for the interactive elements.
* `type`: The type of interaction goal from the `CometChatConstants`.

## Sending InteractiveMessages

The `InteractiveMessage` can be sent using the `sendInteractiveMessage` method of the `CometChat` class. The method requires an `InteractiveMessage` object and a `CallbackListener` for handling the response.

Here is an example of how to use it:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```js
const interactiveData = {
title: "Survey",
formFields: [
  {
    elementType: "textInput",
    elementId: "name",
    optional: false,
    label: "Name",
    placeholder: {
      text: "Enter text here"
    }
  },
  {
    elementType: "textInput",
    elementId: "age",
    optional: true,
    label: "Age",
    maxLines: 1,
    placeholder: {
      text: "Enter text here"
    }
  },
  {
    elementType: "Select",
    elementId: "checkBox1",
    optional: true,
    label: "Check box element",
    defaultValue: ["chk_option_2"],
    options: [
      {
        label: "Option 1",
        value: "chk_option_1"
      },
      {
        label: "Option 2",
        value: "chk_option_2"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    elementType: "dropdown",
    elementId: "gender",
    optional: false,
    label: "Gender",
    defaultValue: "male",
    options: [
      {
        label: "Male",
        value: "male"
      },
      {
        label: "Female",
        value: "female"
      }
    ]
  }
],
submitElement: {
  elementType: "button",
  elementId: "submitButton",
  buttonText: "Submit",
  disableAfterInteracted: false,
  action: {
    actionType: "urlNavigation",
    url: "https://www.cometchat.com/"
  }
}
};



const interactiveMessage = new CometChat.InteractiveMessage(receiverId,receiverType,"form", interactiveData);


CometChat.sendInteractiveMessage(interactiveMessage)
          .then((message: CometChat.InteractiveMessage) => {
             // This block is executed when the InteractiveMessage is sent successfully.
          })
          .catch((error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
              // This block is executed if an error occurs while sending the InteractiveMessage.
          });
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Event Listeners

CometChat SDK provides event listeners to handle real-time events related to `InteractiveMessage`.

## On InteractiveMessage Received

The `onInteractiveMessageReceived` event listener is triggered when an `InteractiveMessage` is received.

Here is an example:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```js
CometChat.addMessageListener(
  "UNIQUE_ID",
  new CometChat.MessageListener({
      onInteractiveMessageReceived: (message: CometChat.InteractiveMessage) => {
        			// This block is executed when an InteractiveMessage is received.
							// Here you can define logic to handle the received InteractiveMessage and display it in 										your chat interface.
      },
  })
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

On Interaction Goal Completed

The `onInteractionGoalCompleted` event listener is invoked when an interaction goal is achieved.

Here is an example:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```js
CometChat.addMessageListener(
  "UNIQUE_ID",
  new CometChat.MessageListener({
      onInteractionGoalCompleted: (receipt: CometChat.InteractionReceipt) => {
          // This block is executed when an interaction goal is completed.
          // Here you can specify the actions your application should take once an interaction goal is 								achieved, such as updating the UI or notifying the user.
      },
  })
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

These event listeners offer your application a way to provide real-time updates in response to incoming interactive messages and goal completions, contributing to a more dynamic and responsive user chat experience.

## Usage

An InteractiveMessage is constructed with the receiver's UID, the receiver type, the interactive type, and interactive data as a JSONObject. Once created, the InteractiveMessage can be sent using CometChat's sendInteractiveMessage() method. Incoming InteractiveMessages can be received and processed via CometChat's message listener framework.

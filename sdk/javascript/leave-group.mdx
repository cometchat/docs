## Real-time Group Member Left Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know if someone has left it?*

CometChat.addGroupListener(
  "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID",
  new CometChat.GroupListener({
      onGroupMemberLeft: (message, leavingUser, group) => {
          console.log("User left", { message, leavingUser, group });
      }
  })
);

## Missed Group Member Left Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know if someone has left it when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has left any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For the group member left event, in the `Action` object received, the following fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - `left`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who left the group
3. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the group the user has left

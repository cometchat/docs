title: "Ban Or Kick Member From A Group"
---



There are certain actions that can be performed on the group members:

1. Kick a member from the group
2. Ban a member from the group
3. Unban a member from the group
4. Update the scope of the member of the group

All the above actions can only be performed by the **Admin** or the **Moderator** of the group.

## Kick a Group Member

The Admin or Moderator of a group can kick a member out of the group using the `kickGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Kick Group Member">
```javascript
var GUID = "GUID";
var UID = "UID";

CometChat.kickGroupMember(GUID, UID).then(
response => {
  console.log("Group member kicked successfully", response);
}, error => {
  console.log("Group member kicking failed with error", error);
}
);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let UID: string = "UID";

CometChat.kickGroupMember(GUID, UID).then(
  (response: Object) => {
      console.log("Group member kicked successfully", response);
  }, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
      console.log("Group member kicking failed with error", error);
  }
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `kickGroupMember()` takes following parameters

| Parameter | Description                                           |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `UID`     | The UID of the user to be kicked.                     |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group from which user is to be kicked |

The kicked user will be no longer part of the group and can not perform any actions in the group, but the kicked user can rejoin the group.

## Ban a Group Member

The Admin or Moderator of the group can ban a member from the group using the `banGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Ban Group Member">
```javascript
var GUID = "GUID";
var UID = "UID";

CometChat.banGroupMember(GUID, UID).then(
response => {
  console.log("Group member banned successfully", response);
}, error => {
  console.log("Group member banning failed with error", error);
}
);   
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let UID: string = "UID";

CometChat.banGroupMember(GUID, UID).then(
  (response: Object) => {
      console.log("Group member banned successfully", response);
  }, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
      console.log("Group member banning failed with error", error);
  }
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `banGroupMember()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                            |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `UID`     | The UID of the user to be banned.                      |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group from which user is to be banned. |

The banned user will be no longer part of the group and can not perform any actions in the group. A banned user cannot rejoin the same group without being unbanned.

## Unban a Banned Group Member from a Group

Only Admin or Moderators of the group can unban a previously banned member from the group using the `unbanGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Unban Group Member">
```javascript
var GUID = "GUID";
var UID = "UID";

CometChat.unbanGroupMember(GUID, UID).then(
response => {
  console.log("Group member unbanned successfully", response);
}, error => {
  console.log("Group member unbanning failed with error", error);
}
);  
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let UID: string = "UID";

CometChat.unbanGroupMember(GUID, UID).then(
  (response: Object) => {
      console.log("Group member unbanned successfully", response);
  }, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
      console.log("Group member unbanning failed with error", error);
  }
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `unbanGroupMember()` method takes the following parameters

| Parameter | Description                                          |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `UID`     | The UID of the user to be unbanned.                  |
| `GUID`    | The UID of the group from which user is to be banned |

The unbanned user can now rejoin the group.

## Get List of Banned Members for a Group

In order to fetch the list of banned groups members for a group, you can use the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class. To use this class i.e to create an object of the BannedGroupMembersRequest class, you need to use the `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class. The `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the parameters based on which the banned group members are to be fetched.

The `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the below parameters:

The `GUID` of the group for which the banned members are to be fetched must be specified in the constructor of the `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class.

### Set Limit

This method sets the limit i.e. the number of banned members that should be fetched in a single iteration.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Set Limit">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let bannedGroupMembersRequest = new CometChat.BannedMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  																.setLimit(limit)
  																.build();
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let bannedGroupMembersRequest: CometChat.BannedMembersRequest = new CometChat.BannedMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Set Search Keyword

This method allows you to set the search string based on which the banned group members are to be fetched.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Set Search Keyword">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let searchKeyword = "super";
let bannedGroupMembersRequest = new CometChat.BannedMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  																.setLimit(limit)
  																.setSearchKeyword(searchKeyword)
  																.build();
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let searchKeyword: string = "super";
let bannedGroupMembersRequest: CometChat.BannedMembersRequest = new CometChat.BannedMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setSearchKeyword(searchKeyword)
  .build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Finally, once all the parameters are set to the builder class, you need to call the build() method to get the object of the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class.

Once you have the object of the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class, you need to call the `fetchNext()` method. Calling this method will return a list of `GroupMember` objects containing n number of banned members where n is the limit set in the builder class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Banned Group Members Request">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let bannedMembersRequest = new CometChat.BannedMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  													.setLimit(limit)
  													.build();

bannedMembersRequest.fetchNext().then(
bannedMembers => {
  console.log("Banned Group Member list fetched successfully:", bannedMembers);
}, error => {
  console.log("Banned Group Member list fetching failed with exception:", error);
}
);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let bannedGroupMembersRequest: CometChat.BannedMembersRequest = new CometChat.BannedMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();

bannedGroupMembersRequest.fetchNext().then(
  (bannedMembers: CometChat.GroupMember[]) => {
      console.log("Banned Group Member list fetched successfully:", bannedMembers);
  }, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
      console.log("Banned Group Member list fetching failed with exception:", error);
  }
);
```

## Real-Time Group Member Kicked/Banned Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is banned/kicked when my app is running?*

In order to get real-time events for the kick/ban/unban group members you need to override the following methods of the `GroupListener` class.

1. `onGroupMemberKicked()` - triggered when any group member has been kicked.
2. `onGroupMemberBanned()` - triggered when any group member has been banned.
3. `onGroupMemberUnbanned()` - triggered when any group member has been unbanned.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Group Listener">
```javascript
let listenerID = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";

CometChat.addGroupListener(
listenerID,
new CometChat.GroupListener({
  onGroupMemberKicked: (message, kickedUser, kickedBy, kickedFrom) => {
    console.log("User kicked", { message, kickedUser, kickedBy, kickedFrom });
  },
  onGroupMemberBanned: (message, bannedUser, bannedBy, bannedFrom) => {
    console.log("User banned", { message, bannedUser, bannedBy, bannedFrom });
  },
  onGroupMemberUnbanned: (message, unbannedUser, unbannedBy,unbannedFrom) => {
    console.log("User unbanned", {message, unbannedUser, unbannedBy, unbannedFrom});
  }
})
);  
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let listenerID: string = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";

CometChat.addGroupListener(
  listenerID,
  new CometChat.GroupListener({
      onGroupMemberKicked: (message: CometChat.Action, kickedUser: CometChat.User, kickedBy: CometChat.User, kickedFrom: CometChat.Group) => {
          console.log("User kicked", { message, kickedUser, kickedBy, kickedFrom });
      },
      onGroupMemberBanned: (message: CometChat.Action, bannedUser: CometChat.User, bannedBy: CometChat.User, bannedFrom: CometChat.Group) => {
          console.log("User banned", { message, bannedUser, bannedBy, bannedFrom });
      },
      onGroupMemberUnbanned: (message: CometChat.Action, unbannedUser: CometChat.User, unbannedBy: CometChat.User, unbannedFrom: CometChat.Group) => {
          console.log("User unbanned", { message, unbannedUser, unbannedBy, unbannedFrom });
      }
  })
);

## Missed Group Member Kicked/Banned Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is banned/kicked when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has been kicked/banned/unbanned from any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For group member kicked event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `kicked`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has kicked the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been kicked
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was kicked

For group member banned event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `banned`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has banned the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been banned
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was banned

For group member unbanned event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `unbanned`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has unbanned the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been unbanned
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was unbanned

## Change Scope of a Group Member

In order to change the scope of a group member, you can use the `changeGroupMemberScope()`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Change Scope">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let UID = "UID";
let scope = CometChat.GROUP_MEMBER_SCOPE.ADMIN;

CometChat.updateGroupMemberScope(GUID, UID, scope).then(
response => {
  console.log("Group member scopped changed", response);
}, error => {
  console.log("Group member scopped changed failed", error);
}
);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let UID: string = "UID";


CometChat.updateGroupMemberScope(GUID, UID, CometChat.GroupMemberScope.Admin).then(
  (response: boolean) => {
      console.log("Group member scopped changed", response);
  }, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
      console.log("Group member scopped changed failed", error);
  }
);
```

This method takes the below parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UID`     | The UID of the member whose scope you would like to change                                                                                                  |
| `GUID`    | The GUID of the group for which the member's scope needs to be changed                                                                                      |
| `scope`   | The updated scope of the member. This can be either of the 3 values: 1.`CometChat.SCOPE.ADMIN`2.`CometChat.SCOPE.MODERATOR` 3.`CometChat.SCOPE.PARTICIPANT` |

The default scope of any member is `participant`. Only the **Admin** of the group can change the scope of any participant in the group.

## Real-Time Group Member Scope Changed Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone's scope is changed when my app is running?*

In order to receive real-time events for the change member scope event, you will need to override the `onGroupMemberScopeChanged()` method of the `GroupListener` class

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Group Listener">
```javascript
let listenerID = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";

CometChat.addGroupListener(
listenerID,
new CometChat.GroupListener({
  onGroupMemberScopeChanged: (message, changedUser, newScope, oldScope, changedGroup) => {
    console.log("User joined", {message, changedUser, newScope, oldScope, changedGroup});
  }
})
);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let listenerID: string = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";

CometChat.addGroupListener(
  listenerID,
  new CometChat.GroupListener({
      onGroupMemberScopeChanged: (message: CometChat.Action, changedUser: CometChat.User, newScope: string, oldScope: string, changedGroup: CometChat.Group) => {
          console.log("User joined", { message, changedUser, newScope, oldScope, changedGroup });
      }
  })
);
```

## Missed Group Member Scope Changed Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone's scope is changed when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member's scope has been changed for any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For the group member scope changed event, in the `Action` object received, the following fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - `scopeChanged`
2. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the user whose scope has been changed
3. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who changed the scope of the member
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the group in which the member scope was changed
5. `oldScope` - The original scope of the member
6. `newScope` - The updated scope of the member

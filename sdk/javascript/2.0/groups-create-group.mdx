## Create a Group

*In other words, as a logged-in user, how do I create a public, private or password-protected group?*

You can create a group using `createGroup()` method. This method takes a `Group` object as input.

To create an object of `Group` class, you can use either of the below two constructors:

1. `new Group(String GUID, String name, String groupType, String password)`
2. `new Group(String GUID, String name, String groupType, String password, String icon, String description)`

The `groupType` needs to be either of the below 3 values:

1.`CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PUBLIC`

2.`CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PASSWORD`

3.`CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PRIVATE`

<Tab title="Create Group">
```javascript
var GUID = "GUID";
var groupName = "Hello Group!";
var groupType = CometChat.GROUP_TYPE.PUBLIC;
var password = "";

var group = new CometChat.Group(GUID, groupName, groupType, password);

CometChat.createGroup(group).then(
  group => {
  	console.log("Group created successfully:", group);
  }, error => {
  	console.log("Group creation failed with exception:", error);
  }
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The createGroup() method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                  |
| :--------- | :---------------------------- |
| `group`   | An instance of `Group` class |

After successful creation of the group, you will receive an instance of `Group` class which contains all the information about the particular group.

<Warning>

GUID can be alphanumeric with underscore and hyphen. Spaces, punctuation and other special characters are not allowed.

Mentions are a powerful tool for enhancing communication in messaging platforms. They streamline interaction by allowing users to easily engage and collaborate with particular individuals, especially in group conversations.

Mentions in messages enable users to refer to specific individuals within a conversation.

## Send Mentioned Messages

Every User object has a String unique identifier associated with them which can be found in a property called `uid`. To mention a user in a message, the message text should contain the `uid` in following format: `<@uid:UID_OF_THE_USER>`. For example, to mention the user with UID `cometchat-uid-1` in a text message, your text should be `"<@uid:cometchat-uid-1>"`

let messageText = "Hello, <@uid:cometchat-uid-1>"
let receiverType = CometChat.ReceiverType.user

CometChat.sendTextMessage(message:textMessage){ textMessage in
                print("Message sent successfully: (textMessage.text), mentioned users: (textMessage.getMentionedUsers())")
        } onError: { error in

## Mentioned Messages

By default, the SDK will fetch all the messages irrespective of the fact that the logged-in user is mentioned or not in the message.

The SDK allows you to fetch messages in a conversation where the logged-in user is mentioned. The SDK also has other optional filters such as tag info and blocked info.

| Setting                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mentionsWithTagInfo(bool value)`     | If set to `true`, SDK will fetch a list of messages where users are mentioned and will also fetch the tags of the mentioned users. Default value is `false`.                    |
| `mentionsWithBlockedInfo(bool value)` | If set to `true`, SDK will fetch a list of messages where users are mentioned and will also fetch their blocked relationship with the logged-in user. Default value is `false`. |

## Get Users Mentioned In a Particular Message

title: "Default Calling"
---



This section will provide information on how a complete calling workflow can be set up using CometChat. We've built the complete workflow to help your users make calls, receive calls as well as accept/reject calls.

Let us assume Alex to be the call initiator and Bob is the receiver.

1. Alex initiates the call to Bob using the `initiateCall()` method.
2. Bob now has two choices:

* Accept the call from Alex using the `acceptCall()` method.
* Reject the call from Alex using the `rejectCall("rejected")` method passing the status as `rejected`.

3. In the meantime, Alex has the option to cancel the call he initiated to Bob using the `rejectCall("cancelled")` method passing the status as `cancelled`.
4. If Bob accepts the call from Alex, both Alex and Bob need to call the `startCall()` method. Alex in the `onIncomingCallReceived()` method of the `CallListener` and Bob in the success obtained from the call to `acceptCall()` method and both will be connected to each other.

## Initiate Call

The `initiateCall()` method sends a call request to a user or a group.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let receiverID = "UID"
let receiverType:CometChat.ReceiverType = .user OR.group
let callType: CometChat.CallType = .audio OR .video

let newCall = Call(receiverId: receiverID, callType: callType, receiverType: receiverType);

CometChat.initiateCall(call: newCall, onSuccess: { (ongoing_call) in

  print("Call initiated successfully " + ongoing_call!.stringValue());

}) { (error) in

  print("Call initialization failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);

}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSString *receiverID = @"UID";

Call *newCall = [[Call alloc]initWithReceiverId:receiverID callType:CallTypeVideo receiverType:ReceiverTypeUser];

[CometChat initiateCallWithCall:newCall onSuccess:^(Call * ongoing_call) {
    
    NSLog(@"Call initiated successfully. %@",[ongoing_call stringValue]);
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
    
    NSLog(@"Call initialization failed with error: %@",[error ErrorDescription]);
}];
```

This method takes an object of the `Call` class. The constructor for `Call` class takes the following parameters:

| Parameter    | Description                                   |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| receiverID   | The UID or GUID of the recipient              |
| receiverType | The type of the receiver viz. - user - group  |
| callType     | The type of the receiver viz. - audio - video |

## Receive Calls

In order to receive all `call` events, you must add protocol conformance `CometChatCallDelegate` as Shown Below :

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
extension ViewController: CometChatCallDelegate {

  func onIncomingCallReceived(incomingCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print(" Incoming call " + incomingCall!.stringValue());
  }

  func onOutgoingCallAccepted(acceptedCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print("Outgoing call " + acceptedCall!.stringValue());
  }

  func onOutgoingCallRejected(rejectedCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print("Rejected call " + rejectedCall!.stringValue());
  }
  func onIncomingCallCanceled(canceledCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print("Cancelled call " + canceledCall!.stringValue());
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
@interface ViewController ()<CometChatCallDelegate>

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    [CometChat setCalldelegate:self];
}

- (void)onIncomingCallCanceledWithCanceledCall:(Call * _Nullable)canceledCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {
    
    NSLog(@"Incoming call cancelled %@",[canceledCall stringValue]);
}

- (void)onIncomingCallReceivedWithIncomingCall:(Call * _Nullable)incomingCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {
    
    NSLog(@"Incoming call %@",[incomingCall stringValue]);
}

- (void)onOutgoingCallAcceptedWithAcceptedCall:(Call * _Nullable)acceptedCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {
    
    NSLog(@"Outgoing call accepted %@",[acceptedCall stringValue]);
}

- (void)onOutgoingCallRejectedWithRejectedCall:(Call * _Nullable)rejectedCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {
    
    NSLog(@"Outgoing call rejected %@",[rejectedCall stringValue]);
}

@end
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Do not forget to set your view controller as a CometChat delegate probably in `viewDidLoad()` as `CometChat.calldelegate = self`

As mentioned in the [Overview](/sdk/ios/3.0/calling) section, Once the call is initiated, there are three options that can be possible:

1. The receiver of the call accepts the call.
2. The receiver of the call rejects the call.
3. The initiator of the call cancels the call.

Please find below how these three scenarios can be implemented:

Accept the incoming Call

Once you have received an incoming call from a `user` or in any `group` in `onIncomingCallReceived(incomingCall:, error:)`, you need to accept the call using the `acceptCall()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.acceptCall(sessionID: incomingCall!.sessionID, onSuccess: { (ongoing_call) in
            
  print("Accepted Call. " + call!.stringValue());

}) { (error) in

  print("Call accepting failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
[CometChat acceptCallWithSessionID:incomingCall.sessionID onSuccess:^(Call * ongoing_call) {
   
    NSLog(@"Accepted call. %@",[ongoing_call stringValue]);
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
    
    NSLog(@"Call accepting failed with error: %@",[error ErrorDescription]);
    
}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Reject the incoming Call

You can also choose to reject the incoming call once it is received using the `rejectCall()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let status: CometChatConstants.callStatus = .rejected;

CometChat.rejectCall(sessionID: (incomingCall?.sessionID)!, status: status, onSuccess: { (rejeceted_call) in
                    
  print("Call rejected successfully. " + rejeceted_call!.stringValue());
  
}) { (error) in

  print("Call rejection failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
[CometChat rejectCallWithSessionID:incomingCall.sessionID status:callStatusRejected onSuccess:^(Call * rejeceted_call) {
    
    // Success
    NSLog("Call rejected successfully %@ " , [rejeceted_call stringValue]);
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
    
    // Error
    NSLog("Call rejection failed with exception:  %@" + [error ErrorDescription]);
}];
```

</Tab>

|             |                                                      |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`    | Reason for rejection of the call                     |
| `sessionID` | The unique session ID available in the `Call` object |

Here the status needs to be set as `CometChatConstants.callStatus.rejected` as the call is being rejected by the receiver of the call.

Cancel the Outgoing Call

In the case where the initiator wishes to cancel the call, use the same above `rejectCall()` method and just pass the status to the `rejectCall()` method as `CometChatConstants.callStatus.cancelled`

The possible values for the status can be one of the below:

| status    | interpretation                                                             | Enum available |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| rejected  | The receiver rejects the call as it is received without accepting the call | .rejected      |
| cancelled | The initiator ends the call without the receiver accepting the call        | .cancelled     |
| busy      | The receiver rejects the call, as he/she is busy on another call           | .busy          |

## Start the Call

Once the call request is sent and the receiver has accepted the call, both the initiator and the receiver need to call the `startCall()` method.

You need to call this method for two scenarios:

1. After you accept an incoming call i.e. in the `onSuccess()` callback of the `acceptCall()` method.
2. After the recipient accepts an outgoing call i.e. in the `onOutgoingCallAccepted()` method of the `CometChatCallDelegate`.

    let sessionID = ongoing_call.sessionID
    let callSettings = CallSettings.CallSettingsBuilder(callView: callView, sessionId:sessionID).build()

    CometChat.startCall(callSettings: callSettings, userJoined: { (joined_user) in
       print("Joined User: " + joined_user.stringValue())

<Note>

The current `startCall()` method which takes the `callView`, `sessionId`, to load the call view`parameters directly, is deprecated and will be replaced in the future versions. It will continue to work on this version but we suggest moving to the new method as shown above using the object of the`CallSettings\` class as the parameter.

</Note>

| Parameter   | Description                                          |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`      | The view that you want to show the calling view in.  |
| `sessionID` | The unique session ID available in the `Call` object |

The `OngoingCallListener` listener provides you with the below callback methods:

| `userJoined`            | This method is called when any other user joins the call. The user details can be obtained from the `User` object provided.  |
| `userLeft`              | This method is called when a user leaves the call. The details of the user can be obtained from the provided `User` object.  |
| `onError`               | This method is called when there is some error in establishing the call.                                                     |
| `callEnded`             | This method is called when the call is successfully ended. The call details can be obtained from the `Call` object provided. |
| `userListUpdated`       | This method is triggered every time a participant joins or leaves the call providing the list of users active in the call    |
| `audioModesUpdated`     | This callback is triggered if any new audio output source is available or becomes unavailable.                               |
| `onUserMuted`           | This method is triggered when a user is muted in the ongoing call.                                                           |
| `onCallSwitchedToVideo` | This callback is triggered when an audio call is converted into a video call.                                                |
| `onRecordingStarted`    | This method is triggered when a user starts video recording.                                                                 |

## Settings

The `CallSettings` class is the most important class when it comes to the implementation of the Calling feature. This is the class that allows you to customize the overall calling experience. The properties for the call/conference can be set using the `CallSettingsBuilder` class. This will eventually give you and object of the `CallSettings` class which you can pass to the `startCall()` method to start the call.

The **mandatory** parameters that are required to be present for any call/conference to work are:

1. View - A View object in which the calling UI is loaded.
2. sessionId - The unique session Id for the call/conference session.

The options available for customisation of calls are:

In case you wish to achieve a completely customised UI for the Calling experience, you can do so by embedding default UI buttons to the screen as per your requirement and then use the below methods to achieve different functionalities for the embedded buttons.

For the use case where you wish to align your own custom buttons and not use the default layout provided by CometChat, you can embed the buttons in your layout and use the below methods to perform the corresponding operations:

### Switch Camera

Switch Camera You can call `switchCamera()` Method to toggle between camera sources.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.switchCamera()
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Mute Audio

Mute Audio You can call `muteAudio()` Method to mute your Audio Stream to the end-user.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.muteAudio(mute: true) //toggle this value for unmuting the user's audio
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If set to `true` the Audio Stream is muted and if set to`false` Audio Stream is transmitted.

### Pause Video

You can call `pauseVideo()` Method to pause Video Stream to the end-user.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.pauseVideo(pauseVideo: true) //toggle this value for resuming the user's video
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If set to `true` the Video Stream is muted and if set to`false` Video Stream is transmitted.

### Audio Mode

You can call `setAudioMode()` to set the output of the audio stream.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let callmanager = CallManager()
callmanager.audioMode(setAudioMode: .EARPIECE)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The audio mode can have either one of the below 4 values:

* SPEAKER
* EARPIECE
* BLUETOOTH
* HEADPHONES

### End Call

End Call is handled internally by CometChat when using the default UI provided. Once the user presses the end call button, CometChat internally triggers the action to end the call.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
var sessionID = "" //sessionId of the call

CometChat.endCall(sessionID: sessionID, onSuccess: { (call) in
            
    print("Success \(String(describing: call?.description))")
}) { (error) in

    print("Error \(String(describing: error?.errorDescription))")
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Get list of available audio modes

This method will return the list of available audio modes. Based on the list received, you can set the audio mode for the ongoing call using the `setAudioMode()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.getAudioModes { (modes) in
	print("Available audio modes received \(modes)")
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The AudioMode class has the below properties:

1. mode - The mode can be either one of the below values:

* SPEAKER
* EARPIECE
* BLUETOOTH
* HEADPHONES

2. isSelected - This is a boolean value that indicates if the audio mode is the active mode.

## Active Call

CometChat provides a method to get the details of the call that is currently active. The `CometChat.getActiveCall()` will return an object of the `Call` containing the details of the ongoing call. If there is no ongoing call this method will return nil.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
var onGoingCall = CometChat.getActiveCall()
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Call Participant Count

In order to get the number of participants in any call, you can use the `getCallParticipantCount()` method. This method takes the session id of the call and returns the number of participants that are active in the call.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let sessionID = "12345"

 CometChat.getCallParticipantCount(sessionId: "", type: .DIRECT, onSucces:  {
      (count) in
      print("Count \(count)")
 }, onError: { (error) in
      print("OnError \(error?.errorDescription)")
 })
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

When a user logs into your app, you need to programmatically login the user into CometChat. But before you log in the user to CometChat, you need to create the user.

Summing up-

**When a user registers in your app**

1. You add the user details in your database
2. You create a user in CometChat

**When a user logs into your app**

1. You log in the user to your app
2. You [log in the user to CometChat](/sdk/ios/3.0/authentication) (programmatically)

## Creating a user

Ideally, user creation should take place at your backend. You can refer our Rest API to learn more about [Creating a user](https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/creates-user) and use the appropriate code sample based on your backend language.

However, if you wish to create users on the fly, you can use the `createUser()` method. This method takes a `User` object and the `Auth Key` as input parameters and returns the created `User` object if the request is successful.

<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let newUser : User = User(uid: "user1", name: "Kevin") // Replace with your uid and the name for the user to be created.
let authKey = "AUTH_KEY" // Replace with your Auth Key.
CometChat.createUser(user: newUser, apiKey: authKey, onSuccess: { (User) in
      print("User created successfully. \(User.stringValue())")
  }) { (error) in
     print("The error is \(String(describing: error?.description))")
}
```

<Warning>

UID can be alphanumeric with underscore and hyphen. Spaces, punctuation and other special characters are not allowed.

## Updating a user

Updating a user similar to creating a user should ideally be achieved at your backend using the Restful APIs. For more information, you can check the [update a user](https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/update-user) section. However, this can be achieved on the fly as well using the `updateUser()` method. This method takes a `User` object and the Auth Key as inputs and returns the updated `User` object on successful execution of the request.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let updateUser : User = User(uid: "user1", name: "Kevin Fernandez") // Replace with your uid and the name for the user to be created.
let authKey = "AUTH_KEY" // Replace with your Auth Key.
CometChat.updateUser(user: newUser1, apiKey: authKey, onSuccess: { (User) in
     print("User updated successfully. \(User.stringValue())")
 }) { (error) in
     print("The error is \(String(describing: error?.description))")
 }
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Please make sure the `User` object provided to the `updateUser()` method has the `UID` of the user to be updated set.

## Updating logged-in user

Updating a logged-in user is similar to updating a user. The only difference being this method does not require an AuthKey. This method takes a `User` object as input and returns the updated `User` object on the successful execution of the request.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let currentUser = User(uid: "cometchat-uid-1", name: "Andrew Joseph")
CometChat.updateCurrentUserDetails(user: currentUser, onSuccess: { user in
	print("Updated user object",user)                  
}, onError: { error in
	print("Update user failed with error: \(error?.errorDescription)")
})
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

By using the `updateCurrentUserDetails()` method one can only update the logged-in user irrespective of the UID passed. Also, it is not possible to update the role of a logged-in user.

## Deleting a user

Deleting a user can only be achieved via the Restful APIs. For more information please check the [delete a user](https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/delete-user) section.

## Mark Messages as Delivered

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I inform the sender that I've received a message?*

You can mark the messages for a particular conversation as read using the `markAsDelivered()` method. This method takes the below parameters as input:

| **messageId** | **The ID of the message above which all the messages for a particular conversation are to be marked as read.**                                                                              |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| receiverId    | In the case of one-to-one conversation, the sender's sender `UID` will be the receipt's receiver Id. In case of group conversation message's receiver Id will be the receipt's receiver Id. |
| receiverType  | Type of the receiver. Could be either of the two values( user or group)                                                                                                                     |
| messageSender | The UID of the sender of the message.                                                                                                                                                       |

Messages for both user conversation and group conversation can be marked as delivered using this method.

Ideally, you should mark all the messages as read for any conversation when the user opens the chat window for that conversation. This includes two scenarios:

1. **When the list of messages for the conversation is fetched**: In this case you need to obtain the last message in the list of messages and pass the message ID of that message to the markAsDelivered() method.
2. **When the user is on the chat window and a real-time message is received:** In this case you need to obtain the message ID of the message and pass it to the markAsDelivered() method.

This method will mark all the messages before the messageId specified, for the conversation with receiverId and receiverType(user/group) as read.

In case you would like to be notified of an error if the receipts fail to go through you can use `markAsDelivered()` method with the callbacks as shown below:

## Mark Messages as Read

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I inform the sender I've read a message?*

You can mark the messages for a particular conversation as read using the `markAsRead()` method. This method takes the below parameters as input:

| Parameter     | Information                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| messageId     | The ID of the message above which all the messages for a particular conversation are to be marked as read.                                                                          |
| receiverId    | In case of one to one conversation message's sender `UID` will be the receipt's receiver Id. In case of group conversation message's receiver Id will be the receipts's receiver Id |
| receiverType  | type of the receiver. Could be either of the two values( user or group)                                                                                                             |
| messageSender | The UID of the sender of the message.                                                                                                                                               |

<Note>

Starting v3, the `markAsRead()` method working with v2.x is deprecated and will not work. You will either have to use one of the above method signatures to mark the messages as read.

</Note>

## Mark Messages as Unread

The Mark as Unread feature allows users to designate specific messages or conversations as unread, even if they have been previously viewed.

This feature is valuable for users who want to revisit and respond to important messages or conversations later, ensuring they don't forget or overlook them.

In other words, how I can mark message as unread?

You can mark the messages for a particular conversation as unread using the `markAsUnread()` method. This method takes the below parameters as input:

| Field               | Information                                     |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| conversationId      | id of the conversation                          |
| conversationType    | type of conversation (user/group)               |
| lastMessage         | last message in the conversation                |
| conversationWith    | User or Group object containing the details     |
| unreadMessageCount  | unread message count for the conversation       |
| unreadMentionsCount | count of unread mentions in the conversation    |
| lastReadMessageId   | ID of the last read message in the conversation |

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let txt = TextMessage(receiverUid: "cometchat-uid-3", text: "this is unread count test", receiverType: .user)
txt.id = 3 // the message with id 3 will be marked unread. ID is required.
txt.sender = User(uid: "cometchat-uid-2", name: "George Alan")

CometChat.markAsUnread(baseMessage: txt) {
         print("markAsUnread executed successfully: on message with ID: \(txt.id) and text \(txt.text)")
} onError: { error in
         print("markAsUnread not executed error: \(error?.errorDescription)")

## Receive Delivery & Read Receipts

*In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when a message I sent has been delivered or read by someone?*

### Real-time Events

1. `onMessagesDelivered()` - This event is triggered when a message is delivered to a user.
2. `onMessagesRead()` - This event is triggered when a message is read by a user.
3. `onMessagesDeliveredToAll()` - This event is triggered when a group message is delivered to all members of the group. This event is only for Group conversations.
4. `onMessagesReadByAll()` - This event is triggered when a group message is read by all members of the group. This event is only for Group conversations.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
func onMessagesRead(receipt: MessageReceipt) {
   print("onMessagesRead \(receipt.stringValue())")
}
    
func onMessagesDelivered(receipt: MessageReceipt) {
  print("onMessagesDelivered \(receipt.stringValue())")
}

func onMessagesDeliveredToAll(receipt: MessageReceipt) {
  print("onMessagesDeliveredToAll \(receipt.stringValue())")
}

func onMessagesReadByAll(receipt: MessageReceipt) {
  print("onMessagesReadByAll \(receipt.stringValue())")
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
-(void)onMessagesDeliveredWithReceipt:(MessageReceipt *)receipt
{
   NSLog(@"onMessagesDeliveredWithReceipt %@",receipt.stringValue)
}
-(void)onMessagesReadWithReceipt:(MessageReceipt *)receipt
{
   NSLog(@"onMessagesReadWithReceipt %@",receipt.stringValue)
}

-(void)onMessagesDeliveredToAll:(MessageReceipt *)receipt
{
   NSLog(@"onMessagesDeliveredToAll %@",receipt.stringValue)
}
-(void)onMessagesReadByAll:(MessageReceipt *)receipt
{
   NSLog(@"onMessagesReadByAll %@",receipt.stringValue)
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

You will receive events in the form of `MessageReceipt` objects. The message receipt contains the below parameters:

| Parameter    | Information                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| messageId    | The Id of the message prior to which all the messages for that particular conversation have been marked as read.                          |
| sender       | User object containing the details of the user who has marked the message as read. System User for `deliveredToAll` & `readByAll` events. |
| receiverId   | Id of the receiver whose conversation has been marked as read.                                                                            |
| receiverType | type of the receiver (user/group)                                                                                                         |
| receiptType  | Type of the receipt (read/delivered)                                                                                                      |
| deliveredAt  | The timestamp of the time when the message was delivered. This will only be present if the receiptType is delivered.                      |
| readAt       | The timestamp of the time when the message was read. This will only be present when the receiptType is read.                              |

### Missed Receipts

You will receive message receipts when you load offline messages. While fetching messages in bulk, the message object will have two fields i.e. `deliveredAt` and `readAt` which hold the timestamp for the time the message was delivered and read respectively. Using these two variables, the delivery and read status for a message can be obtained.

However, for a group message, if you wish to fetch the `deliveredAt` and `readAt` fields of individual member of the group you can use the below-described method.

### Receipt History for a Single Message

To fetch the message receipts, you can use the `getMessageReceipts()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
var messageId = 10101;

CometChat.getMessageReceipts(messageId, onSuccess: { (receipt) in
            
  print("getMessageReceipt \(receipt)")                                           
}) { (error) in
  print(error?.errorDescription)
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
int messageId =10101;

[CometChat getMessageReceipts:messageId onSuccess:^(NSArray<MessageReceipt *> * _Nonnull receipt) {
        
        NSLog(@"getMesssageReceipts %@",receipt);
    } onError:^(CometChatException * _Nullable error) {
        
        NSLog(@"CometChatException %@",error.errorDescription);
    }];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

You will receive a list of `MessageReceipt` objects in the `onSuccess()` method.

<Info>

The following features will be available only if the **Enhanced Messaging Status** feature is enabled for your app.

* `onMessagesDeliveredToAll` event,
* `onMessagesReadByAll` event,
* `deliveredAt` field in a group message,
* `readAt` field in a group message.
* `markAsUnread` method.

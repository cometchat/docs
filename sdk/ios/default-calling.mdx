title: "Default Calling"
---



This section will provide information on how a complete calling workflow can be set up using CometChat. We've built the complete workflow to help your users make calls, receive calls as well as accept/reject calls.

Let us assume Alex to be the call initiator and Bob is the receiver.

1. Alex initiates the call to Bob using the `initiateCall()` method.

2. Bob now has two choices:\
   a. Accept the call from Alex using the `acceptCall()` method.\
   b. Reject the call from Alex using the `rejectCall("rejected")` method passing the status as `rejected`.

3. In the meantime, Alex has the option to cancel the call he initiated to Bob using the `rejectCall("cancelled")` method passing the status as `cancelled`.

4. If Bob accepts the call from Alex, both Alex and Bob need to call the `startCall()` method. Alex in the `onIncomingCallReceived()` method of the `CallListener` and Bob in the success obtained from the call to `acceptCall()` method and both will be connected to each other.

## Initiate Call

The `initiateCall()` method sends a call request to a user or a group.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let receiverID = "UID"
let receiverType:CometChat.ReceiverType = .user OR.group
let callType: CometChat.CallType = .audio OR .video

let newCall = Call(receiverId: receiverID, callType: callType, receiverType: receiverType);

CometChat.initiateCall(call: newCall, onSuccess: { (ongoing_call) in

  print("Call initiated successfully " + ongoing_call!.stringValue());

}) { (error) in

  print("Call initialization failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);

}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSString *receiverID = @"UID";

Call *newCall = [[Call alloc]initWithReceiverId:receiverID callType:CallTypeVideo receiverType:ReceiverTypeUser];

[CometChat initiateCallWithCall:newCall onSuccess:^(Call * ongoing_call) {

    NSLog(@"Call initiated successfully. %@",[ongoing_call stringValue]);

} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {

    NSLog(@"Call initialization failed with error: %@",[error ErrorDescription]);
}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

This method takes an object of the `Call` class. The constructor for `Call` class takes the following parameters:

|              | Properties                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter    | Descriptions                                  |
| receiverID   | The UID or GUID of the recipient              |
| receiverType | The type of the receiver viz. - user - group  |
| callType     | The type of the receiver viz. - audio - video |

## Receive Calls

In order to receive all `call` events, you must add protocol conformance `CometChatCallDelegate` as Shown Below :

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
extension ViewController: CometChatCallDelegate {
  func onIncomingCallReceived(incomingCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print(" Incoming call " + incomingCall!.stringValue());
  }

  func onOutgoingCallAccepted(acceptedCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print("Outgoing call " + acceptedCall!.stringValue());
  }

  func onOutgoingCallRejected(rejectedCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print("Rejected call " + rejectedCall!.stringValue());
  }
  func onIncomingCallCanceled(canceledCall: Call ? , error : CometChatException ? ) {
    print("Cancelled call " + canceledCall!.stringValue());
  }

  func onCallEndedMessageReceived(endedCall: Call?, error: CometChatException?) {
    print(" Ended call " + endedCall!.stringValue())
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
@interface ViewController ()<CometChatCallDelegate>

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [CometChat setCalldelegate:self];
}

- (void)onIncomingCallCanceledWithCanceledCall:(Call * _Nullable)canceledCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {

    NSLog(@"Incoming call cancelled %@",[canceledCall stringValue]);
}

- (void)onIncomingCallReceivedWithIncomingCall:(Call * _Nullable)incomingCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {

    NSLog(@"Incoming call %@",[incomingCall stringValue]);
}

- (void)onOutgoingCallAcceptedWithAcceptedCall:(Call * _Nullable)acceptedCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {

    NSLog(@"Outgoing call accepted %@",[acceptedCall stringValue]);
}

- (void)onOutgoingCallRejectedWithRejectedCall:(Call * _Nullable)rejectedCall error:(CometChatException * _Nullable)error {

    NSLog(@"Outgoing call rejected %@",[rejectedCall stringValue]);
}

@end
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Do not forget to set your view controller as a CometChat delegate probably in `viewDidLoad()` as `CometChat.calldelegate = self`

As mentioned in the [Integration](/sdk/ios/calling-integration) section, Once the call is initiated, there are three options that can be possible:

1. The receiver of the call accepts the call.
2. The receiver of the call rejects the call.
3. The initiator of the call cancels the call.

Please find below how these three scenarios can be implemented:

### Accept the incoming Call

Once you have received an incoming call from a `user` or in any `group` in `onIncomingCallReceived(incomingCall:, error:)`, you need to accept the call using the `acceptCall()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChat.acceptCall(sessionID: incomingCall!.sessionID, onSuccess: { (ongoing_call) in

  print("Accepted Call. " + call!.stringValue());

}) { (error) in

  print("Call accepting failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
[CometChat acceptCallWithSessionID:incomingCall.sessionID onSuccess:^(Call * ongoing_call) {

    NSLog(@"Accepted call. %@",[ongoing_call stringValue]);

} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {

    NSLog(@"Call accepting failed with error: %@",[error ErrorDescription]);

}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Reject the incoming Call

You can also choose to reject the incoming call once it is received using the `rejectCall()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let status: CometChatConstants.callStatus = .rejected;

CometChat.rejectCall(sessionID: (incomingCall?.sessionID)!, status: status, onSuccess: { (rejeceted_call) in

  print("Call rejected successfully. " + rejeceted_call!.stringValue());

}) { (error) in

  print("Call rejection failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
[CometChat rejectCallWithSessionID:incomingCall.sessionID status:callStatusRejected onSuccess:^(Call * rejeceted_call) {

    __ Success
    NSLog("Call rejected successfully %@ " , [rejeceted_call stringValue]);

} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {

    __ Error
    NSLog("Call rejection failed with exception:  %@" + [error ErrorDescription]);
}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

|           | Properties                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| status    | Reason for rejection of the call                     |
| sessionID | The unique session ID available in the `Call` object |

Here the status needs to be set as `CometChatConstants.callStatus.rejected` as the call is being rejected by the receiver of the call.

### Cancel the Outgoing Call

In the case where the initiator wishes to cancel the call, use the same above `rejectCall()` method and just pass the status to the `rejectCall()` method as `CometChatConstants.callStatus.cancelled`

The possible values for the status can be one of the below:

|           | Description                                                                |                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| status    | interpretation                                                             | Enum available |
| rejected  | The receiver rejects the call as it is received without accepting the call | .rejected      |
| cancelled | The initiator ends the call without the receiver accepting the call        | .cancelled     |
| busy      | The receiver rejects the call, as he/she is busy on another call           | .busy          |

## Start a Call

Once the call request is sent and the receiver has accepted the call, both the initiator and the receiver need to call the [startSession()](/sdk/ios/direct-calling#start-call-session) method.

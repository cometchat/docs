title: "Add Members To A Group"
---



You can add members to the group using the `addMembersToGroup()` method. This method takes the below parameters:

1. GUID - GUID of the group the members are to be added to.
2. `Array<GroupMember>` members - This is a list of `GroupMember` objects. In order to add members, you need to create an object of the `GroupMember` class. The UID and the scope of the GroupMember are mandatory.
3. `Array<String>` bannedMembers - This is the list of UIDs that need to be banned from the Group. This can be set to `nil` if there are no members to be banned.
4. Callback.

In the `onSuccess()` callback, you will receive a dictionary which will contain the UID of the users and the value will either be `success` or an error message describing why the operation to add the user to the group or ban the user failed.

## Real-Time Group Member Added Events

To receive Real-Time Events for the same, you need to implement the `onMemberAddedToGroup()` method of the `GroupListener` class.

<Note>

When a group member is added by another member, this event is triggered. When a user joins a group on their own, the joined event is triggered.

</Note>

* `onMemberAddedToGroup()` - This method is triggered when other users are added to the group so that the logged in user is informed of the other members added to the group or this method is triggered when the LoggedIn User is added to the Group.

## Member Added to Group event in Message History

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is added to the group when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has been added to any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For the group member added event, in the `Action` object received, the following fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - `added`
2. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the user who was added to the group.
3. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who added the member to the group.
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the group to which the member was added.

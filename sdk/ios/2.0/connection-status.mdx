title: "Connection Status"
---



CometChat SDK provides you with a mechanism to get real-time status of the connection to CometChat web-socket servers. This can be achieved by registering for the events using the `CometChatConnectionDelegate` class.

Connection Status provides you with the below 3 methods to get the status of the connection to CometChat web-socket servers:

| Delegate Method | Information                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| connecting      | This method is triggered when CometChat SDK is trying to establish a connection to the web-socket server.                                        |
| connected       | This method is called when CometChat SDK has successfully established a connection and now is connected.                                         |
| disconnected    | This method is called when the CometChat SDK gets disconnected due to any issue while maintaining the connection like network fluctuations, etc. |

Once the connection is broken, the disconnected callback is triggered, the SDK automatically tries to establish the connection again, thus going into the connecting state and triggering the `connecting` method. Once the attempt to connect is successful, the `connected` method is triggered thus letting the developer know that the connection is established and is active.

In order to use the Delegate methods you must add protocol conformance `CometChatConnectionDelegate` as `CometChat.conectiondelegate = self` . Here is the example of CometChatConnectionDelegate:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
extension AppDelegate: CometChatConnectionDelegate {

	func connecting() {
    
  	print("connecting")
  }
    
  func connected() {
        
    print("connected")  
  }
    
  func disconnected() {
  
  	print("disconnected")
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
@interface ViewController ()<CometChatConnectionDelegate>

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    [CometChat connectiondelegate:self];
}

- (void)connecting() {
    
    NSLog(@"Connecting");
}

- (void)connected() {
    
    NSLog(@"Connected");
}

- (void)disconnected() {
    
    NSLog(@"Disconnected");
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

We recommend you to add the Connection Status delegate in your AppDelegate and in your app's first view controller that opens when you log in.

</Note>

You can also get the current connection status by using `getConnectionStatus` property provided by CometChat SDK

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
var connectionStatus = CometChat.getConnectionStatus?.value
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `CoimetChat.getConnectionStatus` method will return either of the below 3 values:

1. connecting
2. connected
3. disconnected

title: "Ban/Kick Members From A Group"
---



There are certain actions that can be performed on the group members:

1. Kick a member from the group
2. Ban a member from the group
3. Unban a member from the group
4. Update the scope of the member of the group

Please note: All the above-mentioned actions can only be performed by the **Admin** or the **Moderator** of the group.

## Kick a Group Member

The Admin or Moderator of the group can kick a member out of the group using the `kickUser()` method provided by the CometChat class. This method can be used as shown below:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let uid  = "UID"; // Uid of the user to be kicked
let guid  = "GUID"; // guid of the group the user is to be kicked from

CometChat.kickGroupMember(UID: uid, GUID: guid, onSuccess: { (response) in

  print("\(uid) is kicked from the group \(guid) successfully.")

}) { (error) in

  print("Group member kicking failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSString *UID = @"UID"; // Uid of the user to be kicked
NSString *GUID = @"GUID"; // guid of the group the user is to be kicked from

[CometChat kickGroupMemberWithUID:UID GUID:GUID onSuccess:^(NSString * response) {
   NSLog(@"%@ kicked from the group %@ successfully", UID, GUID);
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
    
    NSLog(@"Group member kicking failed with error: %@",[error errorDescription]);
    
}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `kickGroupMember()` takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                           |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| UID       | The UID of the user to be kicked                      |
| GUID      | The GUID of the group from which user is to be kicked |

The kicked user will be no longer part of the group and can not perform any actions in the group, but the kicked user can rejoin the group.

## Ban a Group Member

The Admin or Moderator of the group can ban a member from the group using the `banGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let uid  = "UID"; 
let guid  = "GUID"	;

CometChat.banGroupMember(UID: uid, GUID: guid, onSuccess: { (response) in

  print("\(uid) is banned from the group \(guid) successfully.")

}) { (error) in

  print("Group member baning failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSString *UID = @"UID";
NSString *GUID = @"GUID";

[CometChat banGroupMemberWithUID:UID GUID:GUID onSuccess:^(NSString * response) {
   
   NSLog(@"%@ banned from the group %@ successfully", UID, GUID);
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
    
    NSLog(@"Group member baning failed with error: %@",[error errorDescription]);
    
}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `banGroupMember()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                           |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| UID       | The UID of the user to be banned                      |
| GUID      | The GUID of the group from which user is to be banned |

The banned user will be no longer part of the group and can not perform any actions in the group. A banned user cannot rejoin the group the same group without being unbanned.

## Unban a Banned Group Member from a Group

Only Admin or Moderators of the group can unban a previously banned member from the group using the `unbanGroupMember()` method.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let uid  = "cometchat-uid-1"; // Uid of the user to be reinstated
let guid  = "cometchat-guid-11"	; // guid of the group the user is to be reinstated into

CometChat.unbanGroupMember(UID: uid, GUID: guid, onSuccess: { (response) in

  print("\(uid) is unbanned from the group \(guid) successfully.")

}) { (error) in

  print("Group member unbaning failed with error:  " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSString *UID = @"UID";
NSString *GUID = @"GUID";

[CometChat unbanGroupMemberWithUID:UID GUID:GUID onSuccess:^(NSString * response) {
    NSLog(@"%@ unbanned from the group %@ successfully", UID, GUID);
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
    
    NSLog(@"Group member unbaning failed with error: %@",[error errorDescription]);
    
}];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `unbanGroupMember()` method takes the following parameters

| Parameter | Description                                           |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| UID       | The UID of the user to be unbanned.                   |
| GUID      | The UID of the group from which user is to be banned. |

The unbanned user can now rejoin the group.

## Get List of Banned Members for a Group

In order to fetch the list of banned groups members for a group, you can use the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class. To use this class i.e to create an object of the BannedGroupMembersRequest class, you need to use the `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class. The `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the parameters based on which the banned group members are to be fetched.

The `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the below parameters:

The GUID of the group for which the banned members are to be fetched must be specified in the constructor of the `BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder` class.

1. `set(limit: Int)` - This method sets the limit i.e. the number of banned members that should be fetched in a single iteration.

```swift
let bannedGroupMembersRequest = BannedGroupMembersRequest.BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder(guid: guid).set(limit: limit).build();
```

2. `set(searchKeyword : String)` - This method allows you to set the search string based on which the banned group members are to be fetched.

```swift
let bannedGroupMembersRequest = BannedGroupMembersRequest.BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder(guid: guid)
.set(limit: limit)
.set(searchKeyword: "abc")
.build();
```

Finally, once all the parameters are set to the builder class, you need to call the build() method to get the object of the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class.

Once you have the object of the `BannedGroupMembersRequest` class, you need to call the `fetchNext()` method. Calling this method will return a list of objects containing n number of banned members where n is the limit set in the builder class.

<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let limit = 10;
let guid = "cometchat-guid-11"

let bannedGroupMembersRequest = BannedGroupMembersRequest.BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder(guid: guid).set(limit: limit).build();

bannedGroupMembersRequest.fetchNext(onSuccess: { (groupMembers) in

  for bannedMember in groupMembers {

     print("Group Member fetched successfully. " + bannedMember.stringValue())
  }

}) { (error) in

  print("Banned Group Member list fetching failed with error: " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSString *GUID = @"GUID";
NSInteger limit = 30;

BannedGroupMembersRequest *bannedGroupMemberRequest = [[[[BannedGroupMembersRequestBuilder alloc]initWithGuid:GUID] setLimitWithLimit:limit] build];

[bannedGroupMemberRequest fetchNextOnSuccess:^(NSArray<GroupMember *> * bannedMembers) {
   
    for (GroupMember *member in bannedMembers) {
        
        NSLog(@"Group Member fetched successfully. %@",[member stringValue]);
    }
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
    
    NSLog(@"Banned Group Member list fetching failed with error: %@",[error ErrorDescription]);
}];
```

## Real-Time Group Member Kicked/Banned Events

In order to receive user Events for kick/ban/unban you must add protocol conformance `CometChatGroupDelegate` as shown for following methods:

1. `onGroupMemberKicked()` - triggered when any group member has been kicked.
2. `onGroupMemberBanned()` - triggered when any group member has been banned.
3. `onGroupMemberUnbanned()` - triggered when any group member has been unbanned. methods of the `CometChatGroupDelegate`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
extension AppDelegate: CometChatGroupDelegate {

  func onGroupMemberKicked(action: ActionMessage, kickedUser: User, kickedBy: User, kickedFrom: Group) {

    print("\(kickedUser.name) kicked from the group \(kickedFrom.name) by \(kickedBy.name).")
  }

  func onGroupMemberBanned(action: ActionMessage, bannedUser: User, bannedBy: User, bannedFrom: Group) {

    print("\(bannedUser.name) banned from the group \(bannedFrom.name) by \(bannedBy.name).")
  }

  func onGroupMemberUnbanned(action: ActionMessage, unbannedUser: User, unbannedBy: User, unbannedFrom: Group) {

    print("\(unbannedUser.name) unbanned from the group \(unbannedFrom.name) by \(unbannedBy.name).")

## Missed Group Member Kicked/Banned Events

*In other words, as a member of a group, how do I know when someone is banned/kicked when my app is not running?*

When you retrieve the list of previous messages if a member has been kicked/banned/unbanned from any group that the logged-in user is a member of, the list of messages will contain an `Action` message. An `Action` message is a sub-class of `BaseMessage` class.

For group member kicked event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `kicked`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has kicked the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been kicked
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was kicked

For group member banned event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `banned`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has banned the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been banned
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was banned

For group member unbanned event, the details can be obtained using the below fields of the `Action` class-

1. `action` - `unbanned`
2. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has unbanned the member
3. `actionOn` - User object containing the details of the member that has been unbanned
4. `actionFor` - Group object containing the details of the Group from which the member was unbanned

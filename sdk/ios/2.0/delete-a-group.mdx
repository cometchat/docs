## Delete a Group

To delete a group you need to use the `deleteGroup()` method. The user must be an `Admin` of the group they are trying to delete.

let GUID = "GUID";

CometChat.deleteGroup(GUID: GUID, onSuccess: { (response) in

  print("Group deleted successfully.")

}) { (error) in

  print("Group delete failed with error: " + error!.errorDescription);
}
```

<Tab title="Objective C">
```objc
NSString *guid = @"cometchat-guid-101";

[CometChat deleteGroupWithGUID:guid onSuccess:^(NSString * response) {
    
    NSLog(@"Group deleted successfully.");
    
} onError:^(CometChatException * error) {
   
    NSLog(@"Group deletion failed with error: %@",[error errorDescription]);
    
}];
```

The `deleteGroup()` method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                    |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| GUID      | The GUID of the group you would like to delete |

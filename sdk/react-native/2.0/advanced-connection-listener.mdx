title: "Connection Status"
---



CometChat SDK provides you with a mechanism to get real-time status of the connection to CometChat web-socket servers.

Connection Status provides you with the below 3 methods to get the status of the connection to CometChat web-socket servers:

| Delegate Method | Information                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| connecting      | This method is triggered when CometChat SDK is trying to establish a connection to the web-socket server.                                        |
| connected       | This method is called when CometChat SDK has successfully established a connection and now is connected.                                         |
| disconnected    | This method is called when the CometChat SDK gets disconnected due to any issue while maintaining the connection like network fluctuations, etc. |

Once the connection is broken, the disconnected callback is triggered, the SDK automatically tries to establish the connection again, thus going into the connecting state and triggering the `connecting` method. Once the attempt to connect is successful, the `connected` method is triggered thus letting the developer know that the connection is established and is active.

To receive real-time connection status, you need to register `ConnectionListener` wherever you wish to receive the real-time status. You can use the `addConnectionListener()` method to do so.

<Tab title="Connection Listener">
```javascript
var listenerID = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";
CometChat.addConnectionListener(
    listenerID,
    new CometChat.ConnectionListener({
        onConnected: () => {
            console.log("ConnectionListener => On Connected");
        },
        inConnecting: () => {
            console.log("ConnectionListener => In connecting");
        },
        onDisconnected: () => {
          console.log("ConnectionListener => On Disconnected");
        }
    })
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

We recommend you to add the Connection Listener in your method on app startup, preferably in the index.js file. Once you have successfully initialized CometChat.

</Note>

You can also get the current connection status by using `getConnectionStatus` property provided by CometChat SDK

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Get Connection Status">
```javascript
var connectionStatus = CometChat.getConnectionStatus();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `CoimetChat.getConnectionStatus` method will return either of the below 3 values:

1. connecting
2. connected
3. disconnected

Calling is a core feature of CometChat. Calling allows users to connect over voice/video calls.

## Prerequisites

1. CometChat Core SDK installed.
2. Performed the steps mentioned in the [Setup](/sdk/react-native/overview#calling-component-configuration) guide.

CometChat allows two mechanisms for calling:

1. **Direct Calling**
2. **Default Calling**

## Direct Calling

Direct Calling allows you to start the call/conference sessions directly with the session Id of your choice. All the users joining the same session Id are connected to the same call/conference. For more information on Direct Calling, please visit the [Direct Calling](/sdk/react-native/direct-call).

## Default Calling

The second approach that CometChat SDK allows is to implement the entire calling flow where one user initiates a call/conference. The other user/users who want to be a part of the call accept the call. All the users that accept the call are connected to the same session. The users also have an option to reject the call. For more information on Default Calling, please visit the [Default Calling](/sdk/react-native/default-call).

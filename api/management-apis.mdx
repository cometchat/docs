Welcome to the CometChat's Multi-Tenancy API documentation!\
This comprehensive guide offers in-depth insights into the Multi-tenancy APIs provided by CometChat. Access to Multi-tenancy APIs is exclusive to clients with plans that support this feature. To verify feature availability in your plan, please refer to our pricing page: [https://www.cometchat.com/pricing](https://www.cometchat.com/pricing).

## Introduction

The Multi-Tenancy API provided by CometChat empowers users to execute a wide array of operations at the application level.\
This functionality enables developers to oversee their CometChat applications at the account level through REST APIs, eliminating the need to repeatedly access the dashboard for managing operations related to their multi-tenant apps. This approach offers enhanced control and flexibility in resource management.

## Getting Started

To initiate usage of CometChat's Multi-Tenancy API, it's necessary to reach out to the Sales team to activate it. Once activated, the Sales team will provide you with a key & secret enabling access to the Multi-Tenancy APIs.

## Authentication

All API requests must be accompanied by a key & secret to authenticate the APIs.

## Endpoints

CometChat's REST API offers a variety of endpoints catering to different aspects of multi-tenant functionality, including app management, extensions management, team management, and more. These endpoints are designed to be intuitive and easy to integrate into your application's backend infrastructure.

Example of a Create App API request in curl command syntax:

<CodeGroup>

```swift cURL
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "key: YOUR_KEY" \
-H "secret: YOUR_SECRET" \
-d '{
    "name": "Test app",
    "version": "3",
    "region": "us"
}' "https://apimgmt.cometchat.io/apps"
```

</CodeGroup>

*key and secret need to be replaced in the curl request.*

## Sample Code

To further assist you in integrating CometChat's REST API into your application, we provide sample code snippets in popular programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, NodeJS, and PHP. These snippets demonstrate how to make API requests and handle responses, helping you kickstart your development process.

## Webhooks:



<Info>
1. The Webhook API documentation provides comprehensive guidance on how to integrate and utilize Webhook functionality for real-time event-driven communication.
2. Our platform is designed around the concept of event-driven communication. It allows your applications to subscribe to specific events and receive instant notifications when these events occur.

</Info>



### Please review the following requirements for setting up your webhook endpoint:

<Info>
1. Your webhook endpoint must be accessible over HTTPS. This is essential to ensure the security and integrity of data transmission.
2. Provide us with the URL where you'd like to receive webhook payloads. Webhook payloads would be in JSON format. This URL should be publicly accessible from the internet.
3. Ensure that your endpoint supports the HTTP POST method. Webhook payloads will be delivered via HTTP POST requests.
4. Configure your endpoint to respond immediately to the CometChat server with a 200 OK response.
5. We recommend you use Basic Auth while configuring webhook, so as to validate incoming webhook requests.

</Info>

Here is the list of properties associated with Webhook.

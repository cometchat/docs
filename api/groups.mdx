1. Groups help your users to converse together in a single space. You can have three types of groups - private, public, and password protected.
2. A maximum of 100000 users can be added to a single group. The following error code would be provided **ERR\_PLAN\_QUOTA\_RESTRICTION** if you're trying to add members greater than the limit.
3. They support typing indicators, unread count, transient messages and read receipts.
4. However, once the size of the group exceeds 300, the conversations and unread message counts are not updated.

<Info>

GUIDs would be automatically converted to lowercase while creating a group.

The Moderation Service API provides endpoints for managing and enforcing content moderation rules across various types of messages. This API enables you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) rules and keyword lists, ensuring your platform maintains a safe and compliant environment for users.



Below is an overview of the key functionalities provided by the Moderation Service API:

1. The Rules Management endpoints allow you to define and manage moderation rules to handle inappropriate content based on various conditions
2. The Keywords Management endpoints allow you to create and manage lists of keywords or regex patterns used for content moderation.
3. The list blocked messages endpoint allows you to fetch all the violated messages.
4. Fetches the historical revisions of a rule, detailing all updates made over time.



The default rules include text profanity, AI-based moderation for images and videos, custom profanity (custom messages), contact details, and email content, ensuring comprehensive content moderation.

The text profanity and custom profanity filters scan for words, including those matching regex patterns, and drop the message if a violation is detected.

The AI-based image and video moderation system scans for violations in images and videos and discards the message if a violation is detected. It allows the attachment of the following labels to a rule, enabling moderation for specific categories of images and videos.\
Following are the labels that are available for Image/Video moderation:

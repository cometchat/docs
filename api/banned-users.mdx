Certain actions can be performed on the group members:

1. Kick a member from the group
2. Ban a member from the group.
3. Unban a member from the group.
4. Update the scope of the member of the group.

All the above actions can only be performed by the Admin or the Moderator of the group.

Banning a user API doesn't accept body parameters.\
It simply bans the UID mentioned in the path parameter of the request.

The banned user will be no longer part of the group and can not perform any actions in the group. A banned user cannot rejoin the same group without being unbanned.

**Customise Conversation Previews and Unread Counts**

Tailor the conversation list by choosing which message types appear as the last message for each conversation & increment the unread message count.

The set of keys that is used for toggling features are as follows:

| Key                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                      | Default Value |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `core.conversations.updateOnGroupActions`    | Indicates whether group actions (e.g., member joined, left, banned) should be shown as the last message in a conversation along with the unread count.                          | `true`        |
| `core.conversations.updateOnReplies`         | Indicates whether sending a message in a thread should be shown as the last message in a conversation. Thread replies do **not** increment the unread count.                   | `true`        |
| `core.conversations.updateOnMessageActions`  | Indicates whether message actions (e.g., edited or deleted) should be shown as the last message in a conversation along with the unread count.                                  | `false`       |
| `core.conversations.updateOnCallActivity`    | Indicates whether call activities (e.g., initiated, accepted, rejected) should be shown as the last message in a conversation along with the unread count.                      | `false`       |
| `core.threads.updateOnMessageActions`        | Indicates whether message actions (e.g., edited or deleted) in a thread should be shown as the last message in a conversation along with the unread count.                      | `false`       |
| `core.notifications.push.enabled`            | `true` if Enhanced Push Notifications are enabled for the app, `false` otherwise.                                                                                               | `false`       |
